# A Digital Island - Building Smart Islands for the Network State
Presented by Shervin Pishevar

## Key Topics
- Personal Journey and Motivation
- Nation State Evolution
- Smart Islands Concept
- Physical-Digital Integration
- Network State Implementation
- Norman's Key Development

## Main Points
- **Personal Background**: Born in Iran, lost his nation to the Islamic regime in 1979. Recently helped smuggle Starlink terminals to support Iranian women protesters.
- **Vision Development**: In 2012, proposed the idea of building private city-states to Joe Ondale, leading to early involvement in the network state movement.
- **Current Work**: Through Edison Alpha (venture studio and fund), working on proving network states can function in the physical world.
- **Implementation Approach**: Combines "atoms and bits" - physical and digital integration in synchronicity, similar to his experience with Uber.
- **Smart Islands Project**: 
  - Located at Norman's Key in the Bahamas
  - Only 40 minutes flight from Miami
  - Features the clearest water in the world (NASA-verified)
  - Acquired during the 2009 financial crisis
  - Vision to create "The Hamptons of Miami and Palm Springs"
  - World-class design team:
    - Joseph Dirand (French architect) designing buildings and homes
    - Norman Foster designing 150-person restaurant
  - Infrastructure:
    - Airport capable of handling G650 aircraft
    - Marina larger than St. Barts
    - Custom customs facility
    - Integrated transportation systems

## Relevance to Network State
- Demonstrates practical implementation of network state concepts
- Shows how technology can bypass traditional state control (Starlink example)
- Illustrates the transition from digital to physical manifestation
- Provides a model for autonomous community development
- Offers a blueprint for creating new jurisdictions
- Demonstrates importance of physical infrastructure for digital communities

## Key Innovations
- Integration of physical and digital infrastructure
- Smart island development methodology
- Autonomous governance systems
- Technology-enabled sovereignty
- Strategic location selection for accessibility
- Leveraging existing infrastructure for development
- Custom immigration and transportation solutions

## Implementation Strategy
1. Start with clear vision and purpose
2. Combine physical and digital elements
3. Build supportive infrastructure
4. Leverage technology for autonomy
5. Create scalable governance models
6. Choose strategic locations with natural advantages
7. Build on existing infrastructure where possible
8. Secure world-class design and development partners
9. Establish independent transportation and customs systems

## Notable Quote
"The nation state as it exists... is not relevant anymore. Many of our nation states are being run by gangs, they're being run by dictators, they're being run by corrupt politicians. It's time for something new."

## Key Insight
Each smart island project needs its own airport and customs facilities to ensure true autonomy and accessibility, demonstrating the importance of physical infrastructure in building digital communities.
