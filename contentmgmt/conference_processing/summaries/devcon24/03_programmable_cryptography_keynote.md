# Programmable Cryptography Keynote - Devcon SEA 2024
Speaker: Gub Sheep (Co-founder of Zerx Park, Creator of Dark Forest game)

## Overview
This beginner-level keynote session explores programmable cryptography and its potential to revolutionize how we compute together on the internet. The talk positions programmable cryptography as a key technology for creating "the internet for the next 50 years" by bringing the power of the global internet on-chain.

## Key Points

### Historical Context
- Early internet was primarily a peer-to-peer network for transmitting bits
- Evolution from simple data transmission to the need for collective computation
- Traditional solution: Client-server model with centralized computation

### Current Challenges
- Web servers currently handle:
  - Coordination of computations over multiple users' state
  - Management of private and public state
  - Canonical state decisions
  - Uptime and liveness guarantees

### Ethereum's Contribution
- Introduced new ways of computing together
- Enabled decentralized consensus over global state
- Brought innovations like:
  - Neutral and autonomous marketplaces
  - Permissionless identity registries
  - Interoperable games
  - Decentralized payment systems

### Programmable Cryptography
- Second generation of cryptographic primitives
- Key technologies include:
  - General purpose zero knowledge proofs
  - Multi-party computation
  - Fully homomorphic encryption
  - Witness encryption
  - Functional encryption
  - Obfuscation

### Future Impact
- Aims to bridge the gap between blockchain capabilities and traditional web functionality
- Potential to transform how we compute collectively while maintaining privacy and security
- Could enable new forms of decentralized applications and services

## Significance
This keynote represents a crucial discussion about the future of decentralized computing, highlighting how programmable cryptography could enable more sophisticated and secure ways of computing together without relying on traditional centralized servers.
