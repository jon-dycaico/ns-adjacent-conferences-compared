# This Year in Ethereum - Josh Stark at Devcon SEA 2024

## Overview
Josh Stark, a member of the Ethereum Foundation leadership team, presents a comprehensive overview of Ethereum's current state in 2024, focusing on three main themes: applications, infrastructure, and community.

## Key Points

### 1. Applications
- **Stablecoins**
  - Ethereum ecosystem (L1 + L2s) hosts 55% of all stablecoins
  - Volume comparable to traditional payment systems (Visa/Mastercard)
  - Real-world impact: enabling cross-border remittances (e.g., Bitso in Latin America) and financial tools (e.g., Pinu in Indonesia)

- **DeFi (Decentralized Finance)**
  - Ethereum remains the home of DeFi
  - Offers non-discriminatory financial services: lending, borrowing, insurance, trading, derivatives
  - Real use case: connecting small businesses (e.g., Mexican coffee producers) with lenders through platforms like EUP

- **Emerging Applications**
  - Decentralized Social Networks (e.g., Farcaster, Lens, Zora)
  - Gaming (e.g., E-Frontier MMO with smart contract-based physics)
  - Digital Identity (ENS, privacy-preserving solutions like Anon Aadhar)
  - Real-world Infrastructure (e.g., Glow Solar's farm management)
  - Prediction Markets (e.g., Polymarket)

### 2. Developer Ecosystem
- Nearly half of all crypto developers work in the Ethereum ecosystem
- Strong developer tooling and infrastructure
- Platform where academic ideas become practical applications (e.g., prediction markets, quadratic funding)

### 3. Platform Characteristics
- Described as a "credibly neutral platform" and "canvas for exploration"
- Enables transformation of theoretical ideas into production systems
- Provides "superpowers" to developers through durable, reliable infrastructure

## Significance
The talk emphasizes Ethereum's evolution from experimental technology to a mature platform powering real-world applications while maintaining its role as an innovation hub for new use cases and ideas.
