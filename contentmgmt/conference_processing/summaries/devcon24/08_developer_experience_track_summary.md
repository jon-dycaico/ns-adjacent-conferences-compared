# Developer Experience Track Summary - Devcon SEA 2024

## Session 1: ENS Security and DNS-based Threats
**Speakers:**
- Former CISO of NFL and ENS team member (background in hacking and law)
- Malika Gaza (Legal Research Associate at ENS, IP and Information Law expert)

### Overview
The session focused on security challenges in the ENS ecosystem, particularly addressing DNS-based threats and protecting users from malicious attacks.

### Key Points
1. DNS vs ENS Security

   - Pattern recognition used to identify threats

2. Attack Patterns
   - Typically originate from compromised social media accounts
   - Often use Link Tree as an intermediary
   - Target users through fake airdrops and domain renewal scams
   - Connect victims to malicious smart contracts (wallet drainers)

3. Security Measures
   - Implementation of DNS-based threat intelligence system
   - Regular expression and pattern recognition for early attack detection
   - Focus on protecting ENS users from common attack vectors

### Significance
This session highlights the importance of security in web3 infrastructure, particularly in naming systems. It demonstrates how ENS is learning from DNS vulnerabilities while implementing stronger security measures to protect users.
