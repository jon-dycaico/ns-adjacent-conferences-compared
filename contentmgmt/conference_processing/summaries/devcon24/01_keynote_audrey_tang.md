ancestor the trailer the good end of ancestor   the trailer the good end of ancestor back in 2014 just a decade ago Taiwan back in 2014 just a decade ago Taiwan   back in 2014 just a decade ago Taiwan was facing a real public trust problem was facing a real public trust problem   was facing a real public trust problem uh the trust in the Democratic uh the trust in the Democratic   uh the trust in the Democratic Administration was as high as 9% which Administration was as high as 9% which   Administration was as high as 9% which was not very high uh and the society was was not very high uh and the society was   was not very high uh and the society was very polarized and very angry energies very polarized and very angry energies   very polarized and very angry energies everywhere and so the point uh that we everywhere and so the point uh that we   everywhere and so the point uh that we made back then was that we should not made back then was that we should not   made back then was that we should not succumb to the anger and outrage that succumb to the anger and outrage that   succumb to the anger and outrage that swept across much of the world at a time swept across much of the world at a time   swept across much of the world at a time and instead we should turn conflict into and instead we should turn conflict into   and instead we should turn conflict into co-creation and there's a saying that co-creation and there's a saying that   co-creation and there's a saying that says to give no trust is to get no trust says to give no trust is to get no trust   says to give no trust is to get no trust and in the span of just six years we had and in the span of just six years we had   and in the span of just six years we had rebuil the trust by radically trusting rebuil the trust by radically trusting   rebuil the trust by radically trusting the people and so by 2020 the public the people and so by 2020 the public   the people and so by 2020 the public trust has risen to over trust has risen to over   trust has risen to over   began a decade ago the sunflower began a decade ago the sunflower   began a decade ago the sunflower movement March movement March   movement

Parliament was handling a particular trade negotiation handling a particular trade negotiation   handling a particular trade negotiation but what said is movement apart is that but what said is movement apart is that   but what said is movement apart is that we said that we're not protesters we said that we're not protesters   we said that we're not protesters protesters is against something

so we occupied peacefully Alternatives so we occupied peacefully   Alternatives so we occupied peacefully the parliament for three weeks with half the parliament for three weeks with half   the parliament for three weeks with half a million people on the street and many a million people on the street and many   a million people on the street and many more online and the occupied streets more online and the occupied streets   more online and the occupied streets around the parliament became a live open around the parliament became a live open   around the parliament became a live open citizen assembly anybody can come there citizen assembly anybody can come there   citizen assembly anybody can come there and learn about how exactly does the and learn about how exactly does the

engage in a facilitated conversation   engage in a facilitated conversation both in person and online and every day both in person and online and every day   both in person and online and every day we reach a little bit consensus about we reach a little bit consensus about   we reach a little bit consensus about those specific issues and read them those specific issues and read them   those specific issues and read them allowed and after three weeks something allowed and after three weeks something   allowed and after three weeks something very rare happened in the history of very rare happened in the history of   very rare happened in the history of occupies the speaker of the parliament occupies the speaker of the parliament   occupies the speaker of the parliament accepted or our demands and so that was accepted or our demands and so that was   accepted or our demands and so that was extraordinary and by the end of 2014 the extraordinary and by the end of 2014 the   extraordinary and by the end of 2014 the central government invited us the Civic central government invited us the Civic   central government invited us the Civic activists to join the cabinet as reverse activists to join the cabinet as reverse   activists to join the cabinet as reverse mentors advising the cabinets in art of mentors advising the cabinets in art of   mentors advising the

idea here is bridging systems the first thing we is bridging systems the first thing we   is bridging systems the first thing we did in 2015 was building such bridging did in 2015 was building such bridging   did in 2015 was building such bridging systems online platforms that mirror the systems online platforms that mirror the   systems online platforms that mirror the facilitated dialogues that we had during facilitated dialogues that we had during   facilitated dialogues that we had during the occupation for example this is a the occupation for example this is a   the occupation for example this is a real screenshot back in 2015 about Uber real screenshot back in 2015 about Uber   real screenshot back in 2015 about Uber which involved nonprofessional drivers which involved nonprofessional drivers   which involved nonprofessional drivers uh and which uh really offended the taxi uh and which uh really offended the taxi   uh and which uh really offended the taxi drivers uh caused a lot of conflict both drivers uh caused a lot of conflict both   drivers uh caused a lot of conflict both in the street and online but instead of in the street and online but instead of   in the street and online but instead of letting the discussion devolve into letting the discussion devolve into   letting the discussion devolve into outrage on social media we build our own outrage on social media we build our own   outrage on social media we build our own pro-social media where citizens can pro-social media where citizens can   pro-social media where citizens can express their views constructively and express their views constructively and   express their views constructively and this is the polce platform it's an open this is the polce platform it's an open   this is the polce platform it's an open source platform where people can propose source platform where people can propose   source platform where people can propose ideas like insurance is very important ideas like insurance is very important   ideas like insurance is very important for right sharing and so on and as you for right sharing and so on and as you   for right sharing and so on and as you can see there's this agree button and can see there's this agree button and   can see there's this agree button and disagree button but there's no reply disagree button but there's no reply   disagree button but there's no reply button with with no reply button there's button with with no reply button there's   button with with no reply button there's no room for trolls to grow and uh you no room for trolls to grow and uh you   no room for trolls to grow and uh you can see as you click agree or disagree can see as you click agree or disagree   can see as you click agree or disagree that your avatar that blue circle moves that your avatar that blue circle moves   that your avatar that blue circle moves toward to a cluster a c's cluster uh toward to a cluster a c's cluster uh   toward to a cluster a c's cluster uh where people share with your views and where people share with your views and   where people share with your views and you can see what bonds you together and you can see what bonds you together and   you can see what bonds you together and what are dividing the groups and the what are dividing the groups and the   what are dividing the groups and the idea here is that we focus on the idea here is that we focus on the   idea here is that we focus on the bridging idea the more an idea Bridge bridging idea the more an idea Bridge   bridging idea the more an idea Bridge across groups the more bonus it gets and across groups the more bonus it gets and   across groups the more bonus it gets and so only the idea that speak to all the so only the idea that speak to all the   so only the idea that speak to all the different groups can get agenda setting different groups can get agenda setting   different groups can get agenda setting power to be part of the policy agenda power to be part of the policy agenda   power to be part of the policy agenda and so during the Uber deliberation and so during the Uber deliberation   and so during the Uber deliberation people first agree on the basic facts people first agree on the basic facts   people first agree on the basic facts like what's actually happening and then like what's actually happening and then   like what's actually happening and then we ask how do you feel about those facts we ask how do you feel about those facts   we ask how do you feel about those facts and some were angry some were you know and some were angry some were you know   and some were angry some were you know happy but everybody is an expert in happy but everybody is an expert in   happy but everybody is an expert in their own feelings and this allowed us their own feelings and this allowed us   their own feelings and this allowed us to Cluster based on the shared to Cluster based on the shared   to Cluster based on the shared sentiments and so by the third week we sentiments and so by the third week we   sentiments and so by the third week we had a set of very bridging ideas like had a set of very bridging ideas like   had a set of very bridging ideas like search pricing is acceptable while the search pricing is acceptable while the   search pricing is acceptable while the demand is high but undercutting meters demand is high but undercutting meters   demand is high but undercutting meters is not and so the final regulations is not and so the final regulations   is not and so the final regulations setting this as agenda ensure fairness setting this as agenda ensure fairness   setting this as agenda ensure fairness for both Uber and the local cooperatives for both Uber and the local cooperatives   for both Uber and the local cooperatives in rural areas and so on and so the in rural areas and so on and so the   in rural areas and so on and so the lesson we learned back in 2015 was that lesson we learned back in 2015 was that   lesson we learned back in 2015 was that polarization is not a function of the polarization is not a function of the   polarization is not a function of the people involved it is a function of the people involved it is a function of the   people involved it is a function of the space and so we can Design pro-social space and so we can Design pro-social   space and so we can Design pro-social Systems that reduce polarization as a Systems that reduce polarization as a   Systems that reduce polarization as a function of the space making the group function of the space making the group   function of the space making the group informed consensus into a common informed consensus into a common   informed consensus into a common knowledge like a group selfie that knowledge like a group selfie that   knowledge like a group selfie that everybody sees and say oh actually we do everybody sees and say oh actually we do   everybody sees and say oh actually we do agree with most of our neighbors most of agree with most of our neighbors most of   agree with most of our neighbors most of the time on most of the points and it's the time on most of the points and it's   the time on most of the points and it's just one or two things that divides us just one or two things that divides us   just one or two things that divides us and that group selfie is very

so by promoting those   contributions and so by promoting those notes that bridge differences the system notes that bridge differences the system   notes that bridge differences the system incentivized this idea of constructive incentivized this idea of constructive   incentivized this idea of constructive engagement and so more generally while engagement and so more generally while

uh we can do better and   regenerating it uh we can do better and the poce community notes are just the poce community notes are just   the poce community notes are just prototypes to what we call pro-social prototypes to what we call pro-social   prototypes to what we call pro-social systems and the main idea of prosocial systems and the main idea of prosocial   systems and the main idea of prosocial systems or plural systems as vitalik systems or plural systems as vitalik   systems or plural systems as vitalik wrote in his blog is to treat the wrote in his blog is to treat the   wrote

collaboration happens in small in collaboration happens in small in   collaboration happens in small in homogeneous groups while large scale homogeneous groups while large scale   homogeneous groups

collective trap situation where   kind of collective trap situation where people find it very difficult to leave people find it very difficult to leave   people find it very difficult to leave due to the network effects and peer due to the network effects and peer   due to the network effects and peer pressure and so the people's bid pressure and so the people's bid   pressure and so the people's

innovations that uh you've been working   innovations that uh you've been working on in Taiwan on on Democratic systems on in Taiwan on on Democratic systems   on in Taiwan on on Democratic systems are they merely a better way of are they merely a better way of   are they merely a better way of manufacturing consent or is it possible manufacturing consent or is it possible   manufacturing consent or is it possible that at some point we evolve beyond the that at some point we evolve beyond the   that at some point we evolve beyond the need for hierarchical structures um so a need for hierarchical structures um so a   need for hierarchical structures um so a direct democracy could actually lead to direct democracy could actually lead to   direct democracy could actually lead to better uh decisions within the right better uh decisions within the right   better uh decisions within the right coordinating structures that's a great coordinating structures that's a great   coordinating structures that's a great question um indeed uh I think currently question um indeed uh I think currently   question um indeed uh I think currently the examples I gave is more like in the examples I gave is more like in   the examples I gave is more like in design thinking terms it's like in the design thinking terms it's like in the   design thinking terms it's like in the first diamond it is about um discovering first diamond it is about um discovering   first diamond it is about um discovering the common values and defining how those the common values and defining how those   the common values and defining how those values should be applied to solve values should be applied to solve   values should be applied to solve emerging issue uh but in existing emerging issue uh but in existing   emerging issue uh but in existing representative democracy the second representative democracy the second   representative democracy the second Diamond which is the development of the Diamond which is the development of the   Diamond which is the development of the budgets and policies and the delivery of budgets and policies and the delivery of   budgets and policies and the delivery of such things in the execution layer in such things in the execution layer in   such things in the execution layer in the administration uh these stay the the administration uh these stay the   the administration uh these stay the same so basically this is like a add on same so basically this is like a add on   same so basically this is like a add on uh to the existing representative uh to the existing representative   uh to the existing representative democracy but we do also see for example democracy but we do also see for example   democracy but we do also see for example during the pandemic or the infodemic the during the pandemic or the infodemic the   during the pandemic or the infodemic the disinformation crisis during the disinformation crisis during the   disinformation crisis during the pandemic we do see that there are pandemic we do see that there are   pandemic we do see that there are certain functions that people in Taiwan certain functions that people in Taiwan   certain functions that people in Taiwan do not want the government to run for do not want the government to run for   do not want the government to run for example factchecking um they would think example factchecking um they would think   example factchecking um they would think that if you centralize the authority of that if you centralize the authority of   that if you centralize the authority of factchecking into something that's run factchecking into something that's run   factchecking into something that's run by the government then the government by the government then the government   by the government then the government has an incentive of basically uh saying has an incentive of basically uh saying   has an incentive of basically uh saying uh things that are front of opposition uh things that are front of opposition   uh things that are front of opposition party as as falce or something so in party as as falce or something so in   party as as falce or something so in Taiwan we do not actually concentrate Taiwan we do not actually concentrate   Taiwan we do not actually concentrate that power into the administration but that power into the administration but   that power into the administration but rather rely on the uh collaborative rather rely on the uh collaborative   rather rely on the uh collaborative factchecking in the Civil Society on the factchecking in the Civil Society on the   factchecking in the Civil Society on the open source ecosystem so that for open source ecosystem so that for   open source ecosystem so that for example Facebook or Instagram uh The example Facebook or Instagram uh The   example Facebook or Instagram uh The Meta ecosystem they partner with the Meta ecosystem they partner with the   Meta ecosystem they partner with the time fact checking Center or the mopen time fact checking Center or the mopen   time fact checking Center or the mopen or the collaborative fact checking or the collaborative fact checking   or the collaborative fact checking system and these are in the social system and these are in the social   system and these are in the social sector these are in the Civil Society sector these are in the Civil Society   sector these are in the Civil Society and we make sure in the government that and we make sure in the government that   and we make sure in the government that we just offer like very quick responses we just offer like very quick responses   we just offer like very quick responses to the fact Checkers instead of assuming to the fact Checkers instead of assuming   to the fact Checkers instead of assuming that function ourselves so I think the that function ourselves so I think the   that function ourselves so I think the more um practical way to think about it more um practical way to think about it   more um practical way to think about it is to feel uh in a society whether there is to feel uh in a society whether there   is to feel uh in a society whether there are some functions that people just do are some functions that people just do   are some functions that people just do not want the government to centralize not want the government to centralize   not want the government to centralize and from those fields we can then use and from those fields we can then use   and from those fields we can then use the same coordination measures and then the same coordination measures and then   the same coordination measures and then extend to the development and the extend to the development and the   extend to the development and the delivery um layers and once people have delivery um layers and once people have   delivery um layers and once people have good Peak experience uh like the uh good Peak experience uh like the uh   good Peak experience uh like the uh Society wide deliberation uh and then we Society wide deliberation uh and then we   Society wide deliberation uh and then we can piggy back on those experience and can piggy back on those experience and   can piggy back on those experience and then expand more for direct democracy or then expand more for direct democracy or   then expand more for direct democracy or participatory democracy but it needs to participatory democracy but it needs to   participatory democracy but it needs to be done peace meal instead of just be done peace meal instead of just   be done peace meal instead of just assuming all the governmental functions assuming all the governmental functions   assuming all the governmental functions before the

  and uh if if I had to make an analogy on the the   the um on your kind of um SP and idea is um on your kind of um SP and idea is   um on your kind of um SP and idea is that we're trying to migrate realities that we're trying to migrate realities   that we're trying to migrate realities so we trying to migrate from a physical so we trying to migrate from a physical   so we trying to migrate from a physical reality to something that is more reality to something that is more   reality to something that is more virtual governed by bits and bites maybe virtual governed by bits and bites maybe   virtual governed by bits and bites maybe later other things mhm um but physical later other things mhm um but physical   later other things mhm um but physical reality has a fabric which is very basic reality has a fabric which is very basic   reality has a fabric which is very basic does one person does one person   does one person one vote and that kind of governs one vote and that kind of governs   one vote and that kind of governs morality in some way right um so how are morality in some way right um so how are   morality in some way right um so how are you trying to migrate that because you trying to migrate that because   you trying to migrate that because physical reality has Bad actors and Bad physical reality has Bad actors and Bad   physical reality has Bad actors and Bad actors can exploit the lack of fabric actors can exploit the lack of fabric   actors can exploit the lack of fabric that you have that you don't have in that you have that you don't have in   that you have that you don't have in virtual um realities virtual um realities   virtual um realities namely it's called civil um stability or namely it's called civil um stability or   namely it's called civil um stability or anything like that so what I'm curious anything like that so what I'm curious   anything like that so what I'm curious to understand what you're thinking about to understand what you're thinking about   to understand what you're thinking about that so just uh to clarify the question that so just uh to clarify the question   that so just uh to clarify the question the question is that in physical reality the question is that in physical reality   the question is that in physical reality like each person is physically in one like each person is physically in one   like each person is physically in one space uh it is impossible for me to Fork space uh it is impossible for me to Fork   space uh it is impossible for me to Fork into like 10,000 clones or robotic into like 10,000 clones or robotic   into like 10,000 clones or robotic clones uh and it has been like that for clones uh and it has been like that for   clones uh and it has been like that for thousands of years so I'm that's that's thousands of years so I'm that's that's   thousands of years so I'm that's that's my question basically yeah how do you my question basically yeah how do you   my question basically yeah how do you migrate that principle which is physical migrate that principle which is physical   migrate that principle which is physical to something that is virtual to something that is virtual   to something that is virtual yeah um so for example uh in the Pol yeah um so for example uh in the Pol   yeah um so for example uh in the Pol system or the systems that we run we of system or the systems that we run we of   system or the systems that we run we of course need to ensure that each person course need to ensure that each person   course need to ensure that each person only have one presence uh in that system only have one presence uh in that system   only have one presence uh in that system uh we usually use SMS which works uh we usually use SMS which works   uh we usually use SMS which works domestically because it's if you try to domestically because it's if you try to   domestically because it's if you try to get like 5,000 SMS numbers the in money get like 5,000 SMS numbers the in money   get like 5,000 SMS numbers the in money launching people discover you very launching people discover you very   launching people discover you very quickly uh but beyond the borders uh it quickly uh but beyond the borders uh it   quickly uh but beyond the borders uh it is uh then the need for some sort of is uh then the need for some sort of   is uh then the need for some sort of interoperable like personhood interoperable like personhood   interoperable like personhood credentials the ways to kind of disclose credentials the ways to kind of disclose   credentials the ways to kind of disclose that you're not a bot without overly that you're not a bot without overly   that you're not a bot without overly disclosing anything about yourself that disclosing anything about yourself that   disclosing anything about yourself that becomes very important um and so uh just becomes very important um and so uh just   becomes very important um and so uh just um I think a couple days ago Finland uh um I think a couple days ago Finland uh   um I think a couple days ago Finland uh is now running a hackathon uh that tries is now running a hackathon uh that tries   is now running a hackathon uh that tries to solve this sort of problem because to solve this sort of problem because   to solve this sort of problem because they want to use polce as their they want to use polce as their   they want to use polce as their society-wide public digital society-wide public digital   society-wide public digital infrastructure and so they don't want infrastructure and so they don't want   infrastructure and so they don't want like fins overseas uh to have a lot of like fins overseas uh to have a lot of   like fins overseas uh to have a lot of trouble authenticating but they they trouble authenticating but they they   trouble authenticating but they they also don't want uh people being able to also don't want uh people being able to   also don't want uh people being able to impersonate 10,000 people and so they impersonate 10,000 people and so they   impersonate 10,000 people and so they used exactly the same toolkits that used exactly the same toolkits that   used exactly the same toolkits that you're all developing here the uh zero you're all developing here the uh zero   you're all developing here the uh zero knowledge proofs The Selective knowledge proofs The Selective   knowledge proofs The Selective disclosure verifiable credentials and disclosure verifiable credentials and   disclosure verifiable credentials and things like that and so it's not to make things like that and so it's not to make   things like that and so it's not to make the virtual world a surveilled world at the virtual world a surveilled world at   the virtual world a surveilled world at or world where it's like real name or world where it's like real name   or world where it's like real name transactions but rather just to preserve transactions but rather just to preserve   transactions but rather just to preserve one single feature from the physical one single feature from the physical   one single feature from the physical world which is
