# Core Protocol Track - Stage 4 Day 3 Summary
Devcon SEA 2024

## Session 1: The Age of Account Abstraction - Opportunities and Challenges
Speaker: Danielle Yanev (CEO and Co-founder, Rhino Fi)

### Overview
Discussion of how account abstraction and chain abstraction are transforming the Web3 landscape, focusing on user experience and market dynamics.

### Key Goals
1. **Chain Abstraction**
   - Users oblivious to underlying chain
   - Credit card-like experience
   - Best execution for transactions

2. **Current State**
   - Dapps deployed across multiple chains
   - L2s and chains have direct consumer appeal
   - Separate ecosystems (ideologically and UX)

### Market Impact Predictions

1. **Winner-Take-All Liquidity**
   - Virtuous cycle reinforcing best products
   - Most liquid pools attract more volume
   - Less efficient pools become obsolete

2. **End of Duplication**
   - Same protocols on multiple chains become unsustainable
   - Focus shifts to unique value propositions
   - Rewards for innovation and uniqueness

3. **Chain-Protocol Convergence**
   - Value of chain and protocol converge
   - App-chain thesis revival
   - Single strong use case can justify chain's existence

### Recommendations for Builders
- Avoid forking existing protocols
- Focus on unique value propositions
- Build solutions that matter for the ecosystem
- Target exposure to the entire connected ecosystem

## Session 2: Product-Led Blockchain Development
Speaker: Gregory Rocco (Head of Portfolio, Ethereal Ventures)

### Overview
Discussion of the evolution from product-led growth to product-led blockchain development, focusing on market-driven development.

### Key Frameworks

1. **Product-Led Growth**
   - Customer needs drive development
   - Feedback-driven iteration
   - Focus on user experience

2. **Product-Led Protocol Development**
   - Users interact with apps, not protocols
   - Focus on meaningful daily active users
   - Protocol value tied to client/app success

3. **App-Specific Rollups**
   - Build the killer app for your blockspace
   - Be the use case you want to see
   - Avoid "build it and they will come" mentality

### Best Practices
- Build for actual user needs
- Let market feedback guide development
- Focus on solving real problems
- Prioritize user experience over technical innovation

## Significance
These sessions highlight the Core Protocol track's emphasis on practical implementation and user-centric development. The discussions show a maturing ecosystem moving from technical possibilities to market realities, with a strong focus on sustainable value creation and user adoption.
