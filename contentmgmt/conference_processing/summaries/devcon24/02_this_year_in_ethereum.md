ethereum is   infrastructure of ethereum ethereum is the only blockchain really that's had the only blockchain really that's had   the only blockchain really that's had enough demand and use to test

force us to improve the infrastructure in improve the infrastructure in   improve the infrastructure in response we've taken the hard but response we've taken the hard but   response we've taken the hard but necessary step of actually scaling necessary step of actually scaling   necessary step of actually scaling ethereum and the growth we're seeing now ethereum and the growth we're seeing now   ethereum and the growth we're seeing now is enabled by that investment these is enabled by that investment these   is enabled by that investment these updates include updates to the L1 but updates include updates to the L1 but   updates include updates to the L1 but also the launch and development of also the launch and development of   also the launch and development of ethereum's network of l2s ethereum's network of l2s   ethereum's network of l2s now there's a lot to know about l2s and now there's a lot to know about l2s and   now there's a lot to know about l2s and this week is a great chance to go deep this week is a great chance to go deep   this week is a great chance to go deep on them but I'm going to keep it simple on them but I'm going to keep it simple   on them but I'm going to keep it simple for this talk because the big idea for this talk because the big idea   for this talk because the big idea behind L2 is relatively simple here's behind L2 is relatively simple here's   behind L2 is relatively simple here's ethereum L1 layer 1 aka mainnet the ethereum L1 layer 1 aka mainnet the   ethereum L1 layer 1 aka mainnet the original smart contract platform and the

world but L1 only has so much space so much L1 only has so much space so much   L1 only has so much space so much surface area that can be used and it can surface area that can be used and it can   surface area that can be used and it can be relatively expensive because of that be relatively expensive because of that   be relatively expensive because of that you're paying for these very high you're paying for these very high   you're paying for these very high security and decentralization security and decentralization   security and decentralization properties here are ethereum's l2s they properties here are ethereum's l2s they   properties here are ethereum's l2s they are networks built on top of ethereum L1 are networks built on top of ethereum L1   are networks built on top of ethereum L1 they expand its surface area outwards they expand its surface area outwards   they expand its surface area outwards they make more space available for they make more space available for   they make more space available for developers and users which means that developers and users which means that   developers and users which means that costs can come down but because they can costs can come down but because they can   costs can come down but because they can be attached to L1 in a specific way they be attached to L1 in a specific way they   be attached to L1 in a specific way they can also be extremely secure and can also be extremely secure and   can also be extremely secure and interoperable now we shouldn't be interoperable now we shouldn't be   interoperable now we shouldn't be complacent I think many of us know complacent I think many of us know   complacent I think many of us know there's a lot of work to be done here there's a lot of work to be done here   there's a lot of work to be done here but there's some today in 2024 that this but there's some today in 2024 that this   but there's some today in 2024 that this scaling strategy that the ethereum scaling strategy that the ethereum   scaling strategy that the ethereum ecosystem has invested in is ecosystem has invested in is   ecosystem has invested in is working for one people are using them working for one people are using them   working for one people are using them the adoption of L2 is happening when we the adoption of L2 is happening when we   the adoption of L2 is happening when we look at daily average average look at daily average average   look at daily average average transactions per second this year that transactions per second this year that   transactions per second this year that metric has exploded as more l2s have metric has exploded as more l2s have   metric has exploded as more l2s have launched and as more use is migrating launched and as more use is migrating   launched and as more use is migrating onto them when we look at total value onto them when we look at total value   onto them when we look at total value locked inside ethereum's l2s it also locked inside ethereum's l2s it also   locked inside ethereum's l2s it also exploded earlier this year and it's been exploded earlier this year and it's been   exploded earlier this year and it's been growing steadily since growing steadily since   growing steadily since and at the same time we have low low and at the same time we have low low   and at the same time we have low low fees unlocked by

for less than   dollars to anyone on Earth for less than a cent again that's a cent again that's   a cent again that's [Applause] [Applause]   [Applause] [Music]       incredible and low fees are important incredible and low fees are important   incredible and low fees are important not just for the obvious reason but also not just for the obvious reason but also   not just for the obvious reason but also because they enable a wider diversity of because they enable a wider diversity of   because they enable a wider diversity of use cases they make it possible for the use cases they make it possible for the   use cases they make it possible for the average person to use ethereum and they average person to use ethereum and they   average person to use ethereum and they make it easier for developers to make it easier for developers to   make it easier for developers to experiment with new       things the second piece of evidence is things the second piece of evidence is   things the second piece of evidence is that developers are starting to build that developers are starting to build   that developers are starting to build customized l2s that take advantage of customized l2s that take advantage of   customized l2s that take advantage of the flexibility they can offer each L2 the flexibility they can offer each L2   the flexibility they can offer each L2 in this ring around ethereum expands its in this ring around ethereum expands its   in this ring around ethereum expands its surface area but each of them can be surface area but each of them can be   surface area but each of them can be designed a little bit differently it is designed a little bit differently it is   designed a little bit differently it is its own blockchain that can have its own its own

second big Quest is interoperability and what I mean by that interoperability and what I mean by that   interoperability and what I mean by that is that today using all of these L2 is that today using all of these L2   is that today using all of these L2 networks on ethereum it's not as good as networks on ethereum it's not as good as   networks on ethereum it's not as good as it could be it could be kind of it could be it could be kind of   it could be it could be kind of frustrating and confusing sometimes to frustrating and confusing sometimes to   frustrating and confusing sometimes to move from one L2 onto Main net onto move from one L2 onto Main net onto   move from one L2 onto Main net onto another L2 to interact with someone another L2 to interact with someone   another L2 to interact with someone who's across the ecosystem from you and who's across the ecosystem from you and   who's across the ecosystem from you and using the ethereum ecosystem should just using the ethereum ecosystem should just   using the ethereum ecosystem should just feel like you're using feel like you're using   feel like you're using ethereum it needs to look more like this ethereum it

that is a very significant       Milestone so at the beginning we asked a Milestone so at the beginning we asked a   Milestone so at the beginning we asked a question what is the story of ethereum question what is the story of ethereum   question what is the story of ethereum in 2024 in 2024   in 2024 I see the early stages of a virtuous I see the early stages of a virtuous   I see the early
