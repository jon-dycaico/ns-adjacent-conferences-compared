  [Music]       hello everyone hello everyone very hello everyone hello everyone very   hello everyone hello everyone very excited to introduce you to the tracks excited to introduce you to the tracks   excited to introduce you to the tracks of Devcon and some of the people who of Devcon and some of the people who   of Devcon and some of the people who have been instrumental in creating their have been instrumental in creating their   have been instrumental in creating their content um and yeah to be frank I've content um and yeah to be frank I've   content um and yeah to be frank I've never been that loud in a room so I can never been that loud in a room so I can   never been that loud in a room so I can tell you I'm super excited um few tell you I'm super excited um few   tell you I'm super excited um few numbers first um we had more than 3,000 numbers first um we had more than 3,000   numbers first um we had more than 3,000 applications to speak at Devcon this applications to speak at Devcon this   applications to speak at Devcon this year more than double what we had in year more than double what we had in   year more than double what we had in bota it's pretty amazing to see um yeah bota it's pretty amazing to see um yeah   bota it's pretty amazing to see um yeah thank you thank you thank thank you thank you thank   thank you thank you thank [Applause] [Applause]   [Applause] you um and unfortunately we had room for you um and unfortunately we had room for   you um and unfortunately we had room for around only 15% of them um so the around only 15% of them um so

different tracks um and there will be   different tracks um and there will be content there will be something for content there will be something for   content there will be something for everyone so to share a bit more about everyone so to share a bit more about   everyone so to share a bit more about them I'd like to invite key reviewers them I'd like to invite key reviewers   them I'd like to invite key reviewers from each track who have been from each track who have been   from each track who have been instrumental in creating the amazing instrumental in creating the amazing   instrumental in creating the amazing content that you'll see at Devcon they content that you'll see at Devcon they   content that you'll see at Devcon they will give a rapid pitch about why each will give a rapid pitch about why each   will give a rapid pitch about why each track match matters what are some track match matters what are some   track match matters what are some highlights and who is it for so without highlights and who is it for so without   highlights and who is it for so without further Ado I would like to introduce further Ado I would like to introduce   further Ado I would like to introduce Austin for the developer experience Austin for the developer experience   Austin for the developer experience track thank track thank   track thank [Applause] [Applause]   [Applause] you so so many incredible talks here at you so so many incredible talks here at   you so so many incredible talks here at Devcon uh but like Josh said it's all Devcon uh but like Josh said it's all

track out this is a four kind of feature track out   this is a four kind of feature track out of 80 it was really hard to choose those of 80 it was really hard to choose those   of 80 it was really hard to choose those four but I tried to choose what that is four but I tried to choose what that is   four but I tried to choose what that is the most common uh and then have a more the most common uh and then have a more   the most common uh and then have a more people so we have a       one do you hear the music yeah one with one do you hear the music yeah one with   one do you hear the music

thanks GB sheet hi I'm Alicia and track thanks GB sheet hi I'm Alicia and   track thanks GB sheet hi I'm Alicia and I'm going to talk to you today about the I'm going to talk to you today about the   I'm going to talk to you today about the coordination track so if you're there we coordination track so if you're there we   coordination track so if you're there we go go   go uh if you're wondering what coordination uh if you're wondering what coordination   uh if you're wondering what coordination is actually sitting in this room or is actually sitting in this room or   is actually sitting in this room or being part of Devcon whether you're being part of Devcon whether you're   being part of Devcon whether you're sitting in this room or watching um now sitting in this room or watching um now   sitting in this room or watching um now or in the future is an incredible or in the future is an incredible   or in the future is an incredible example of the power of coordination and example of the power of coordination and   example of the power of coordination and the impact that it can have on ethereum the impact that it can have on ethereum   the impact that it can have on ethereum so other topics or topics that will be so other topics or topics that will be   so other topics or topics that will be covered in the coordination track covered in the coordination track   covered in the coordination track include Dows governance uh public goods include Dows governance uh public goods   include Dows governance uh public goods incentives and tooling and mechanisms incentives and tooling and mechanisms   incentives and tooling and mechanisms that can help us build resilient and that can help us build resilient and   that can help us build resilient and decentralized decentralized   decentralized ecosystems so when you think about why ecosystems so when you think about why   ecosystems so when you think about why coordination is important we often kind coordination is important we often kind   coordination is important we often kind of default to thinking about technical of default to thinking about technical   of default to thinking about technical Concepts in ethereum and obviously that Concepts in ethereum and obviously that   Concepts in ethereum and obviously that makes sense but when you think about it makes sense but when you think about it   makes sense but when you think about it ultimately it comes down to the ultimately it comes down to the   ultimately it comes down to the coordination of people involved in those coordination of people involved in those   coordination of people involved in those projects um that's really what projects um that's really what   projects um that's really what determines the success and growth and determines the success and growth and   determines the success and growth and adoption um of Any Given project in the adoption um of Any Given project in the   adoption um of Any Given project in the ethereum ecosystem so I think that you ethereum ecosystem so I think that you   ethereum ecosystem so I think that you know the importance of coordination is know the importance of coordination is   know the importance of coordination is the ability of humans to coordinate the ability of humans to coordinate   the ability of humans to coordinate across across space and time whether across across space and time whether   across across space and time whether it's you know different countries many it's you know different countries many   it's you know different countries many different time zones that we manag to different time zones that we manag to   different time zones that we manag to get on calls um across languages and get on calls um across languages and   get on calls um across languages and different cultures and experiences um different cultures and experiences um   different cultures and experiences um all coming together for a shared Vision all coming together for a shared Vision   all coming together for a shared Vision so I think that I know everyone says so I think that I know everyone says   so I think that I know everyone says this but I really do think that the this but I really do think that the   this but I really do think that the coordination track can appeal to coordination track can appeal to   coordination track can appeal to everyone whether you're new to the everyone whether you're new to the   everyone whether you're new to the ethereum community or a seasoned veteran ethereum community or a seasoned veteran   ethereum community or a
