# How Governments Can Benefit from Parallel Societies | PSC 2024

## Speakers
- Angelo (Founder of Build Cities)
- Will Wang (Pala Representative)

## Key Concepts

### Current State of Parallel Societies
- Many people are already active participants in parallel societies through:
  - Crypto networks ($2.5 trillion market cap)
  - Digital communities (Discord, Telegram groups)
  - Memecoin communities
  - Financial networks

### Build Cities Platform
- Platform for economic development
- Creates digital twins/DAOs of cities worldwide
- Features:
  - Permissionless capital formation
  - Helps people find digital tribes in local areas
  - Works directly with municipalities for economic development

### Pala Initiative
- World's third smallest country (population < 20,000)
- Founded in 1994
- Location: 4 hours flight from major Asian hubs (Manila, Hong Kong, Taipei)
- Offers RNs ID program (similar to Estonia's e-residency)
- Second country globally to offer digital residency program

### RNs Vision and Solutions
- Addressing two major problems:
  1. Restrictions:
     - Limited access to financial services
     - Barriers to US stock market participation
     - Currency access restrictions
     - Regulatory constraints in crypto markets
  2. Overexposure:
     - Excessive personal data collection (hotels, online services)
     - Unnecessary identity verification requirements
     - Physical address requirements for digital services
- Implementing "minimum disclosure for constraint use" principle:
  - Only sharing information necessary for specific use cases
  - Example: Job applications focusing on expertise rather than personal details
  - Eliminating unnecessary demographic data collection
  - Protection against discrimination and bias
- Focus on privacy and data protection while maintaining functionality

### RNs ID Program Benefits
- Provides legally recognized ID from alternative jurisdiction
- Helps overcome limitations of traditional national IDs:
  - Access to US dollar bank accounts where restricted
  - Participation in crypto exchanges where locally limited
  - Alternative to high-tax jurisdictions (e.g., India's 30% crypto tax)
  - Greater financial flexibility and privacy
- Designed for digital age transactions and activities

## Implementation Strategies
- Digital twins of cities enable permissionless economic development
- Integration with existing municipal structures
- Focus on building local digital communities
- Leveraging blockchain and crypto networks for financial infrastructure
- Creating legal frameworks for digital identity and transactions
- Implementing privacy-preserving verification systems
- Pioneering minimum disclosure frameworks

## Government Benefits

## Future Vision

- Growth of city-based digital communities
- Enhanced economic development through parallel structures
- Creation of more flexible and inclusive identity systems
- Development of privacy-preserving verification standards
- Bridging into global and potentially interplanetary networks
