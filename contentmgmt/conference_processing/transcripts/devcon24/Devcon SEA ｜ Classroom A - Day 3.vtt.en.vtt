00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:54.430 align:start position:0%
phases or chapters that mut went through
um<00:12:52.199><c> so</c><00:12:52.360><c> I</c><00:12:52.480><c> thought</c><00:12:52.760><c> I'd</c><00:12:53.279><c> I</c><00:12:53.440><c> structure</c><00:12:54.000><c> the</c><00:12:54.160><c> talk</c>

00:12:54.430 --> 00:12:54.440 align:start position:0%
um so I thought I'd I structure the talk
 

00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:56.590 align:start position:0%
um so I thought I'd I structure the talk
like<00:12:54.639><c> that</c><00:12:55.440><c> um</c><00:12:55.600><c> so</c><00:12:55.720><c> we</c><00:12:55.880><c> start</c><00:12:56.079><c> with</c><00:12:56.199><c> the</c><00:12:56.360><c> first</c>

00:12:56.590 --> 00:12:56.600 align:start position:0%
like that um so we start with the first
 

00:12:56.600 --> 00:13:00.189 align:start position:0%
like that um so we start with the first
chapter<00:12:57.279><c> make</c><00:12:57.440><c> it</c><00:12:57.639><c> work</c>

00:13:00.189 --> 00:13:00.199 align:start position:0%
chapter make it work
 

00:13:00.199 --> 00:13:01.629 align:start position:0%
chapter make it work
it<00:13:00.399><c> started</c><00:13:00.800><c> basically</c><00:13:01.120><c> three</c><00:13:01.279><c> and</c><00:13:01.399><c> a</c><00:13:01.480><c> half</c>

00:13:01.629 --> 00:13:01.639 align:start position:0%

00:13:06.389 --> 00:13:06.399 align:start position:0%
really inspired by Dark Forest and
 

00:13:06.399 --> 00:13:08.629 align:start position:0%
really inspired by Dark Forest and
decided<00:13:06.720><c> to</c><00:13:06.880><c> build</c><00:13:07.320><c> our</c><00:13:07.519><c> own</c><00:13:07.760><c> fully</c><00:13:08.040><c> onchain</c>

00:13:08.629 --> 00:13:08.639 align:start position:0%
decided to build our own fully onchain
 

00:13:08.639 --> 00:13:12.430 align:start position:0%
decided to build our own fully onchain
game<00:13:09.639><c> and</c><00:13:09.800><c> so</c><00:13:10.560><c> this</c><00:13:10.760><c> was</c><00:13:11.720><c> a</c><00:13:11.880><c> very</c><00:13:12.079><c> early</c>

00:13:12.430 --> 00:13:12.440 align:start position:0%

00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:14.030 align:start position:0%

00:13:21.189 --> 00:13:21.199 align:start position:0%
really matter for the for the game
 

00:13:21.199 --> 00:13:23.430 align:start position:0%
really matter for the for the game
mechanics<00:13:22.120><c> um</c><00:13:22.240><c> but</c><00:13:22.399><c> the</c><00:13:22.560><c> game</c><00:13:23.000><c> at</c><00:13:23.160><c> the</c><00:13:23.279><c> name</c>

00:13:23.430 --> 00:13:23.440 align:start position:0%

00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:24.790 align:start position:0%
mechanics um but the game at the name
stuck<00:13:23.760><c> for</c><00:13:23.880><c> a</c><00:13:24.000><c> little</c>

00:13:24.790 --> 00:13:24.800 align:start position:0%
stuck for a little
 

00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:28.389 align:start position:0%
stuck for a little

00:13:28.389 --> 00:13:28.399 align:start position:0%
bit and then after around six months um
 

00:13:28.399 --> 00:13:30.910 align:start position:0%
bit and then after around six months um
we<00:13:28.600><c> had</c><00:13:29.240><c> this</c><00:13:29.839><c> all</c><00:13:30.000><c> the</c><00:13:30.120><c> game</c><00:13:30.320><c> mechanics</c><00:13:30.680><c> were</c>

00:13:30.910 --> 00:13:30.920 align:start position:0%
we had this all the game mechanics were
 

00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:33.910 align:start position:0%
we had this all the game mechanics were
really<00:13:31.199><c> really</c><00:13:31.440><c> polished</c><00:13:32.440><c> um</c><00:13:32.680><c> all</c><00:13:32.920><c> the</c><00:13:33.680><c> all</c>

00:13:33.910 --> 00:13:33.920 align:start position:0%
really really polished um all the all
 

00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:35.870 align:start position:0%
really really polished um all the all
the<00:13:34.120><c> UI</c><00:13:34.560><c> was</c><00:13:34.680><c> really</c><00:13:34.920><c> polished</c><00:13:35.399><c> polished</c><00:13:35.760><c> as</c>

00:13:35.870 --> 00:13:35.880 align:start position:0%
the UI was really polished polished as
 

00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:38.670 align:start position:0%
the UI was really polished polished as
well<00:13:36.760><c> um</c><00:13:37.000><c> but</c><00:13:37.199><c> we</c><00:13:37.320><c> made</c><00:13:37.639><c> one</c><00:13:37.880><c> big</c><00:13:38.120><c> mistake</c>

00:13:38.670 --> 00:13:38.680 align:start position:0%
well um but we made one big mistake
 

00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:40.230 align:start position:0%
well um but we made one big mistake
which<00:13:38.839><c> was</c><00:13:39.079><c> we</c><00:13:39.199><c> didn't</c><00:13:39.440><c> really</c><00:13:39.560><c> do</c><00:13:39.760><c> any</c><00:13:39.959><c> play</c>

00:13:40.230 --> 00:13:40.240 align:start position:0%
which was we didn't really do any play
 

00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:42.629 align:start position:0%
which was we didn't really do any play
tests<00:13:40.600><c> until</c><00:13:40.920><c> then</c><00:13:41.560><c> we</c><00:13:41.800><c> really</c><00:13:42.000><c> only</c><00:13:42.279><c> played</c>

00:13:42.629 --> 00:13:42.639 align:start position:0%
tests until then we really only played
 

00:13:42.639 --> 00:13:44.629 align:start position:0%
tests until then we really only played
with<00:13:42.800><c> the</c><00:13:42.880><c> two</c><00:13:43.079><c> of</c><00:13:43.199><c> us</c><00:13:43.519><c> we</c><00:13:43.639><c> thought</c><00:13:43.839><c> it's</c><00:13:44.040><c> fun</c>

00:13:44.629 --> 00:13:44.639 align:start position:0%
with the two of us we thought it's fun
 

00:13:44.639 --> 00:13:46.150 align:start position:0%
with the two of us we thought it's fun
and<00:13:44.760><c> maybe</c><00:13:45.079><c> with</c><00:13:45.199><c> a</c><00:13:45.320><c> couple</c><00:13:45.519><c> of</c><00:13:45.680><c> people</c><00:13:45.959><c> from</c>

00:13:46.150 --> 00:13:46.160 align:start position:0%
and maybe with a couple of people from
 

00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:47.710 align:start position:0%
and maybe with a couple of people from
The<00:13:46.320><c> Dark</c><00:13:46.560><c> Forest</c><00:13:46.920><c> office</c><00:13:47.240><c> where</c><00:13:47.360><c> we</c><00:13:47.480><c> were</c>

00:13:47.710 --> 00:13:47.720 align:start position:0%
The Dark Forest office where we were
 

00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:50.150 align:start position:0%
The Dark Forest office where we were
working<00:13:48.000><c> from</c><00:13:48.240><c> at</c><00:13:48.360><c> the</c><00:13:48.519><c> time</c><00:13:49.480><c> um</c><00:13:49.720><c> but</c><00:13:49.880><c> yeah</c><00:13:50.000><c> we</c>

00:13:50.150 --> 00:13:50.160 align:start position:0%
working from at the time um but yeah we
 

00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:52.030 align:start position:0%
working from at the time um but yeah we
never<00:13:50.360><c> did</c><00:13:50.560><c> any</c><00:13:50.800><c> larger</c><00:13:51.160><c> scale</c><00:13:51.440><c> play</c><00:13:51.680><c> tests</c>

00:13:52.030 --> 00:13:52.040 align:start position:0%
never did any larger scale play tests
 

00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:54.189 align:start position:0%
never did any larger scale play tests
and<00:13:52.199><c> so</c><00:13:53.120><c> when</c><00:13:53.240><c> we</c><00:13:53.360><c> did</c><00:13:53.519><c> our</c><00:13:53.680><c> first</c><00:13:53.880><c> larger</c>

00:13:54.189 --> 00:13:54.199 align:start position:0%
and so when we did our first larger
 

00:13:54.199 --> 00:13:57.150 align:start position:0%
and so when we did our first larger
scale<00:13:54.560><c> play</c><00:13:54.800><c> test</c><00:13:55.639><c> um</c><00:13:55.800><c> after</c><00:13:56.079><c> like</c><00:13:56.240><c> 6</c><00:13:56.480><c> months</c>

00:13:57.150 --> 00:13:57.160 align:start position:0%
scale play test um after like 6 months
 

00:13:57.160 --> 00:13:59.189 align:start position:0%
scale play test um after like 6 months
we<00:13:57.320><c> realized</c><00:13:57.720><c> it's</c><00:13:57.959><c> actually</c><00:13:58.160><c> not</c><00:13:58.399><c> as</c><00:13:58.560><c> fun</c><00:13:58.839><c> as</c>

00:13:59.189 --> 00:13:59.199 align:start position:0%
we realized it's actually not as fun as
 

00:13:59.199 --> 00:14:00.910 align:start position:0%
we realized it's actually not as fun as
we<00:13:59.320><c> thought</c><00:14:00.000><c> and</c><00:14:00.079><c> so</c><00:14:00.279><c> lesson</c><00:14:00.560><c> learned</c><00:14:00.839><c> you</c>

00:14:00.910 --> 00:14:00.920 align:start position:0%
we thought and so lesson learned you
 

00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:02.590 align:start position:0%
we thought and so lesson learned you
should<00:14:01.120><c> do</c><00:14:01.279><c> play</c><00:14:01.519><c> tests</c><00:14:01.759><c> early</c><00:14:02.040><c> and</c><00:14:02.199><c> iterate</c>

00:14:02.590 --> 00:14:02.600 align:start position:0%
should do play tests early and iterate
 

00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:05.310 align:start position:0%
should do play tests early and iterate
based<00:14:02.839><c> on</c><00:14:03.040><c> that</c><00:14:04.000><c> um</c><00:14:04.560><c> we</c><00:14:04.720><c> then</c><00:14:04.880><c> tried</c><00:14:05.160><c> to</c>

00:14:05.310 --> 00:14:05.320 align:start position:0%
based on that um we then tried to
 

00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:08.310 align:start position:0%
based on that um we then tried to
iterate<00:14:06.279><c> from</c><00:14:06.480><c> that</c><00:14:06.639><c> point</c><00:14:06.839><c> on</c><00:14:07.519><c> but</c><00:14:08.079><c> because</c>

00:14:08.310 --> 00:14:08.320 align:start position:0%
iterate from that point on but because
 

00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:10.269 align:start position:0%
iterate from that point on but because
of<00:14:08.480><c> the</c><00:14:08.759><c> custom</c><00:14:09.120><c> Network</c><00:14:09.519><c> stack</c><00:14:09.920><c> that</c><00:14:10.040><c> we</c><00:14:10.160><c> had</c>

00:14:10.269 --> 00:14:10.279 align:start position:0%
of the custom Network stack that we had
 

00:14:10.279 --> 00:14:12.350 align:start position:0%
of the custom Network stack that we had
built<00:14:10.720><c> for</c><00:14:11.079><c> this</c><00:14:11.279><c> game</c><00:14:11.560><c> specifically</c><00:14:12.120><c> because</c>

00:14:12.350 --> 00:14:12.360 align:start position:0%
built for this game specifically because
 

00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:14.550 align:start position:0%
built for this game specifically because
there<00:14:12.480><c> was</c><00:14:12.639><c> no</c><00:14:12.800><c> mud</c><00:14:13.079><c> at</c><00:14:13.160><c> the</c><00:14:13.320><c> time</c><00:14:14.079><c> um</c>

00:14:14.550 --> 00:14:14.560 align:start position:0%
there was no mud at the time um
 

00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:15.910 align:start position:0%
there was no mud at the time um
iterating<00:14:15.120><c> on</c><00:14:15.240><c> this</c><00:14:15.399><c> game</c><00:14:15.560><c> was</c><00:14:15.720><c> actually</c>

00:14:15.910 --> 00:14:15.920 align:start position:0%
iterating on this game was actually
 

00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:18.350 align:start position:0%
iterating on this game was actually
really<00:14:16.160><c> hard</c><00:14:16.680><c> and</c><00:14:17.480><c> for</c><00:14:17.720><c> that</c><00:14:17.880><c> let</c><00:14:18.000><c> me</c><00:14:18.120><c> let</c><00:14:18.240><c> me</c>

00:14:18.350 --> 00:14:18.360 align:start position:0%
really hard and for that let me let me
 

00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:20.509 align:start position:0%
really hard and for that let me let me
illustrate<00:14:19.320><c> just</c><00:14:19.519><c> real</c><00:14:19.759><c> quick</c><00:14:20.040><c> how</c><00:14:20.160><c> we</c><00:14:20.279><c> had</c><00:14:20.399><c> to</c>

00:14:20.509 --> 00:14:20.519 align:start position:0%
illustrate just real quick how we had to
 

00:14:20.519 --> 00:14:23.590 align:start position:0%
illustrate just real quick how we had to
do<00:14:20.680><c> things</c><00:14:20.959><c> before</c><00:14:21.240><c> mud</c><00:14:21.680><c> was</c><00:14:21.839><c> a</c><00:14:22.040><c> thing</c><00:14:22.959><c> um</c><00:14:23.440><c> we</c>

00:14:23.590 --> 00:14:23.600 align:start position:0%
do things before mud was a thing um we
 

00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:25.590 align:start position:0%
do things before mud was a thing um we
had<00:14:23.920><c> positions</c><00:14:24.279><c> in</c><00:14:24.360><c> our</c><00:14:24.560><c> game</c><00:14:24.920><c> so</c><00:14:25.120><c> we</c><00:14:25.279><c> created</c>

00:14:25.590 --> 00:14:25.600 align:start position:0%
had positions in our game so we created
 

00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:27.990 align:start position:0%
had positions in our game so we created
a<00:14:25.720><c> mapping</c><00:14:26.120><c> on</c><00:14:26.279><c> our</c><00:14:26.440><c> contracts</c><00:14:27.360><c> and</c><00:14:27.480><c> then</c><00:14:27.680><c> geta</c>

00:14:27.990 --> 00:14:28.000 align:start position:0%
a mapping on our contracts and then geta
 

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:29.590 align:start position:0%
a mapping on our contracts and then geta
functions<00:14:28.279><c> on</c><00:14:28.440><c> the</c><00:14:28.560><c> contracts</c><00:14:29.120><c> so</c><00:14:29.279><c> that</c><00:14:29.440><c> the</c>

00:14:29.590 --> 00:14:29.600 align:start position:0%
functions on the contracts so that the
 

00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:31.749 align:start position:0%
functions on the contracts so that the
client<00:14:29.920><c> can</c><00:14:30.399><c> initialize</c><00:14:30.959><c> the</c><00:14:31.079><c> initial</c><00:14:31.360><c> State</c>

00:14:31.749 --> 00:14:31.759 align:start position:0%
client can initialize the initial State
 

00:14:31.759 --> 00:14:33.870 align:start position:0%
client can initialize the initial State
when<00:14:31.880><c> the</c><00:14:32.000><c> client</c><00:14:32.240><c> loads</c><00:14:32.519><c> up</c><00:14:33.240><c> and</c><00:14:33.440><c> then</c><00:14:33.680><c> we</c>

00:14:33.870 --> 00:14:33.880 align:start position:0%
when the client loads up and then we
 

00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:36.509 align:start position:0%
when the client loads up and then we
also<00:14:34.199><c> had</c><00:14:34.720><c> um</c><00:14:35.240><c> events</c><00:14:35.800><c> whenever</c><00:14:36.240><c> anything</c>

00:14:36.509 --> 00:14:36.519 align:start position:0%
also had um events whenever anything
 

00:14:36.519 --> 00:14:38.069 align:start position:0%
also had um events whenever anything
changed<00:14:36.880><c> on</c><00:14:37.000><c> the</c><00:14:37.160><c> contract</c><00:14:37.480><c> so</c><00:14:37.600><c> here</c><00:14:37.759><c> now</c><00:14:37.880><c> move</c>

00:14:38.069 --> 00:14:38.079 align:start position:0%
changed on the contract so here now move
 

00:14:38.079 --> 00:14:40.910 align:start position:0%

00:14:40.910 --> 00:14:40.920 align:start position:0%
function we have to we have we had to um
 

00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:43.310 align:start position:0%
function we have to we have we had to um
like<00:14:41.639><c> set</c><00:14:42.000><c> the</c><00:14:42.440><c> set</c><00:14:42.600><c> the</c><00:14:42.720><c> storage</c><00:14:43.079><c> but</c><00:14:43.199><c> then</c>

00:14:43.310 --> 00:14:43.320 align:start position:0%
like set the set the storage but then
 

00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:44.829 align:start position:0%
like set the set the storage but then
also<00:14:43.519><c> emit</c><00:14:43.759><c> an</c><00:14:43.880><c> event</c><00:14:44.079><c> and</c><00:14:44.199><c> then</c><00:14:44.399><c> replicate</c>

00:14:44.829 --> 00:14:44.839 align:start position:0%
also emit an event and then replicate
 

00:14:44.839 --> 00:14:48.030 align:start position:0%
also emit an event and then replicate
the<00:14:44.920><c> whole</c><00:14:45.160><c> state</c><00:14:45.519><c> on</c><00:14:45.680><c> the</c><00:14:46.120><c> client</c><00:14:47.120><c> um</c><00:14:47.920><c> and</c>

00:14:48.030 --> 00:14:48.040 align:start position:0%
the whole state on the client um and
 

00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:49.430 align:start position:0%
the whole state on the client um and
then<00:14:48.199><c> we</c><00:14:48.320><c> had</c><00:14:48.440><c> to</c><00:14:48.519><c> do</c><00:14:48.680><c> that</c><00:14:48.800><c> with</c><00:14:48.959><c> every</c><00:14:49.279><c> type</c>

00:14:49.430 --> 00:14:49.440 align:start position:0%
then we had to do that with every type
 

00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:50.670 align:start position:0%
then we had to do that with every type

00:14:52.310 --> 00:14:52.320 align:start position:0%

00:15:07.199 --> 00:15:09.269 align:start position:0%

00:15:09.269 --> 00:15:09.279 align:start position:0%
discovered ECS which which then kind of
 

00:15:09.279 --> 00:15:11.550 align:start position:0%
discovered ECS which which then kind of
like<00:15:09.399><c> made</c><00:15:09.560><c> a</c><00:15:09.680><c> big</c><00:15:10.040><c> impression</c><00:15:10.360><c> of</c><00:15:10.560><c> us</c><00:15:11.000><c> on</c><00:15:11.199><c> us</c>

00:15:11.550 --> 00:15:11.560 align:start position:0%
like made a big impression of us on us
 

00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:12.870 align:start position:0%
like made a big impression of us on us
um<00:15:11.720><c> it's</c><00:15:11.880><c> kind</c><00:15:11.959><c> of</c><00:15:12.079><c> a</c><00:15:12.199><c> pattern</c><00:15:12.519><c> that</c><00:15:12.680><c> people</c>

00:15:12.870 --> 00:15:12.880 align:start position:0%
um it's kind of a pattern that people
 

00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:14.629 align:start position:0%
um it's kind of a pattern that people
use<00:15:13.079><c> in</c><00:15:13.240><c> the</c><00:15:13.720><c> you</c><00:15:13.800><c> know</c><00:15:13.959><c> traditional</c><00:15:14.360><c> gaming</c>

00:15:14.629 --> 00:15:14.639 align:start position:0%

of<00:15:16.519><c> games</c><00:15:17.360><c> and</c><00:15:17.480><c> so</c><00:15:17.759><c> around</c><00:15:18.079><c> this</c><00:15:18.279><c> time</c><00:15:18.519><c> we</c>

00:15:18.670 --> 00:15:18.680 align:start position:0%
of games and so around this time we
 

00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:20.749 align:start position:0%
of games and so around this time we
decided<00:15:19.040><c> to</c><00:15:19.600><c> basically</c><00:15:19.959><c> trash</c><00:15:20.320><c> what</c><00:15:20.480><c> we</c><00:15:20.639><c> have</c>

00:15:20.749 --> 00:15:20.759 align:start position:0%
decided to basically trash what we have
 

00:15:20.759 --> 00:15:23.670 align:start position:0%
decided to basically trash what we have
so<00:15:20.959><c> far</c><00:15:21.639><c> and</c><00:15:21.880><c> instead</c><00:15:22.360><c> build</c><00:15:22.600><c> a</c><00:15:22.720><c> framework</c><00:15:23.399><c> for</c>

00:15:23.670 --> 00:15:23.680 align:start position:0%
so far and instead build a framework for
 

00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:25.829 align:start position:0%
so far and instead build a framework for
ourselves<00:15:24.199><c> to</c><00:15:24.320><c> solve</c><00:15:24.560><c> our</c><00:15:24.680><c> own</c><00:15:24.920><c> problems</c><00:15:25.639><c> so</c>

00:15:25.829 --> 00:15:25.839 align:start position:0%
ourselves to solve our own problems so
 

00:15:25.839 --> 00:15:27.550 align:start position:0%
ourselves to solve our own problems so
that<00:15:26.000><c> we</c><00:15:26.240><c> for</c><00:15:26.440><c> the</c><00:15:26.560><c> next</c><00:15:26.839><c> project</c><00:15:27.160><c> can</c><00:15:27.279><c> skip</c>

00:15:27.550 --> 00:15:27.560 align:start position:0%
that we for the next project can skip
 

00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:29.269 align:start position:0%
that we for the next project can skip
all<00:15:27.680><c> the</c><00:15:27.759><c> boilerplate</c><00:15:28.319><c> and</c><00:15:28.480><c> jump</c><00:15:28.680><c> right</c><00:15:29.000><c> into</c>

00:15:29.269 --> 00:15:29.279 align:start position:0%
all the boilerplate and jump right into
 

00:15:29.279 --> 00:15:31.030 align:start position:0%
all the boilerplate and jump right into
the<00:15:29.519><c> the</c><00:15:29.600><c> game</c><00:15:29.839><c> mechanics</c><00:15:30.279><c> and</c><00:15:30.399><c> iterate</c><00:15:30.920><c> much</c>

00:15:31.030 --> 00:15:31.040 align:start position:0%
the the game mechanics and iterate much
 

00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:33.749 align:start position:0%
the the game mechanics and iterate much
more<00:15:31.399><c> quickly</c><00:15:32.399><c> and</c><00:15:32.519><c> so</c><00:15:32.759><c> that's</c><00:15:33.319><c> basically</c>

00:15:33.749 --> 00:15:33.759 align:start position:0%
more quickly and so that's basically
 

00:15:33.759 --> 00:15:36.470 align:start position:0%
more quickly and so that's basically
what<00:15:33.959><c> became</c><00:15:34.680><c> the</c><00:15:34.959><c> version</c><00:15:35.240><c> one</c><00:15:35.399><c> of</c>

00:15:36.470 --> 00:15:36.480 align:start position:0%
what became the version one of
 

00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:39.350 align:start position:0%
what became the version one of
mud<00:15:37.480><c> we</c><00:15:37.720><c> basically</c><00:15:38.120><c> implemented</c><00:15:38.680><c> ECS</c><00:15:39.160><c> on</c>

00:15:39.350 --> 00:15:39.360 align:start position:0%
mud we basically implemented ECS on
 

00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:42.509 align:start position:0%
mud we basically implemented ECS on

00:15:42.509 --> 00:15:42.519 align:start position:0%

00:15:42.519 --> 00:15:44.509 align:start position:0%

00:15:44.509 --> 00:15:44.519 align:start position:0%

it only took us a couple weeks to build

a<00:15:50.720><c> functioning</c><00:15:51.279><c> prototype</c><00:15:52.279><c> um</c><00:15:52.480><c> this</c><00:15:52.560><c> is</c><00:15:52.759><c> what</c>

00:15:53.309 --> 00:15:53.319 align:start position:0%
a functioning prototype um this is what
 

00:15:53.319 --> 00:15:55.069 align:start position:0%
a functioning prototype um this is what
eventually<00:15:53.680><c> turned</c><00:15:53.959><c> into</c><00:15:54.160><c> Sky</c><00:15:54.480><c> Drive</c><00:15:54.800><c> we</c><00:15:54.920><c> did</c>

00:15:55.069 --> 00:15:55.079 align:start position:0%
eventually turned into Sky Drive we did
 

00:15:55.079 --> 00:15:56.949 align:start position:0%
eventually turned into Sky Drive we did
play<00:15:55.360><c> tests</c><00:15:56.040><c> uh</c><00:15:56.240><c> like</c><00:15:56.360><c> a</c><00:15:56.480><c> lot</c><00:15:56.600><c> of</c><00:15:56.720><c> them</c><00:15:56.880><c> and</c>

00:15:56.949 --> 00:15:56.959 align:start position:0%
play tests uh like a lot of them and
 

00:15:56.959 --> 00:16:00.030 align:start position:0%
play tests uh like a lot of them and
then<00:15:57.120><c> iterated</c><00:15:57.560><c> on</c><00:15:57.680><c> it</c><00:15:58.519><c> and</c><00:15:59.240><c> we</c><00:15:59.440><c> also</c><00:15:59.720><c> built</c>

00:16:00.030 --> 00:16:00.040 align:start position:0%
then iterated on it and we also built
 

00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:01.749 align:start position:0%
then iterated on it and we also built
another<00:16:00.279><c> game</c><00:16:00.480><c> around</c><00:16:00.720><c> this</c><00:16:00.920><c> time</c><00:16:01.399><c> which</c><00:16:01.600><c> we</c>

00:16:01.749 --> 00:16:01.759 align:start position:0%
another game around this time which we
 

00:16:01.759 --> 00:16:04.309 align:start position:0%
another game around this time which we
called<00:16:02.160><c> opcraft</c><00:16:03.160><c> and</c><00:16:03.399><c> that</c><00:16:03.560><c> started</c><00:16:04.000><c> almost</c>

00:16:04.309 --> 00:16:04.319 align:start position:0%
called opcraft and that started almost
 

00:16:04.319 --> 00:16:05.829 align:start position:0%
called opcraft and that started almost
as<00:16:04.440><c> a</c><00:16:04.639><c> challenge</c><00:16:04.959><c> for</c><00:16:05.120><c> ourselves</c><00:16:05.519><c> we</c><00:16:05.600><c> wanted</c>

00:16:05.829 --> 00:16:05.839 align:start position:0%
as a challenge for ourselves we wanted
 

00:16:05.839 --> 00:16:07.749 align:start position:0%
as a challenge for ourselves we wanted
to<00:16:05.959><c> see</c><00:16:06.120><c> if</c><00:16:06.240><c> we</c><00:16:06.399><c> could</c><00:16:06.800><c> put</c><00:16:07.079><c> Minecraft</c><00:16:07.519><c> fully</c>

00:16:07.749 --> 00:16:07.759 align:start position:0%
to see if we could put Minecraft fully
 

00:16:07.759 --> 00:16:11.590 align:start position:0%
to see if we could put Minecraft fully
on<00:16:07.920><c> chain</c><00:16:08.880><c> um</c><00:16:09.360><c> and</c><00:16:09.639><c> turned</c><00:16:09.880><c> out</c><00:16:10.040><c> it's</c><00:16:10.600><c> possible</c>

00:16:11.590 --> 00:16:11.600 align:start position:0%
on chain um and turned out it's possible
 

00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:13.870 align:start position:0%
on chain um and turned out it's possible
and<00:16:12.440><c> um</c><00:16:12.560><c> we</c><00:16:12.680><c> built</c><00:16:13.000><c> actually</c><00:16:13.199><c> the</c><00:16:13.440><c> Prototype</c>

00:16:13.870 --> 00:16:13.880 align:start position:0%
and um we built actually the Prototype
 

00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:15.350 align:start position:0%
and um we built actually the Prototype
of<00:16:14.040><c> this</c><00:16:14.199><c> even</c><00:16:14.399><c> in</c><00:16:14.600><c> in</c><00:16:14.680><c> the</c><00:16:14.839><c> in</c><00:16:14.959><c> the</c><00:16:15.040><c> matter</c><00:16:15.240><c> of</c>

00:16:15.350 --> 00:16:15.360 align:start position:0%
of this even in in the in the matter of
 

00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:17.910 align:start position:0%
of this even in in the in the matter of
a<00:16:15.480><c> couple</c><00:16:15.759><c> days</c><00:16:16.079><c> it</c><00:16:16.319><c> we</c><00:16:16.680><c> we</c><00:16:17.000><c> you</c><00:16:17.120><c> know</c><00:16:17.480><c> cut</c><00:16:17.759><c> some</c>

00:16:17.910 --> 00:16:17.920 align:start position:0%
a couple days it we we you know cut some
 

00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:20.309 align:start position:0%
a couple days it we we you know cut some
corners<00:16:18.519><c> but</c><00:16:19.040><c> um</c><00:16:19.399><c> like</c><00:16:19.600><c> position</c><00:16:19.880><c> for</c><00:16:20.040><c> example</c>

00:16:20.309 --> 00:16:20.319 align:start position:0%
corners but um like position for example
 

00:16:20.319 --> 00:16:21.629 align:start position:0%
corners but um like position for example
wasn't<00:16:20.519><c> fully</c><00:16:20.720><c> Unchained</c><00:16:21.120><c> like</c><00:16:21.240><c> the</c><00:16:21.319><c> player</c>

00:16:21.629 --> 00:16:21.639 align:start position:0%
wasn't fully Unchained like the player
 

00:16:21.639 --> 00:16:24.749 align:start position:0%
wasn't fully Unchained like the player
position<00:16:22.519><c> but</c><00:16:23.399><c> it</c><00:16:23.560><c> was</c><00:16:23.759><c> possible</c><00:16:24.199><c> because</c><00:16:24.440><c> M</c>

00:16:24.749 --> 00:16:24.759 align:start position:0%
position but it was possible because M
 

00:16:24.759 --> 00:16:26.309 align:start position:0%
position but it was possible because M
basically<00:16:25.079><c> solved</c><00:16:25.519><c> almost</c><00:16:25.759><c> all</c><00:16:25.920><c> the</c><00:16:26.040><c> hard</c>

00:16:26.309 --> 00:16:26.319 align:start position:0%
basically solved almost all the hard
 

00:16:26.319 --> 00:16:27.870 align:start position:0%
basically solved almost all the hard
problems<00:16:26.639><c> that</c><00:16:26.759><c> we</c><00:16:26.920><c> had</c><00:16:27.240><c> for</c><00:16:27.440><c> our</c><00:16:27.600><c> first</c>

00:16:27.870 --> 00:16:27.880 align:start position:0%
problems that we had for our first
 

00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:29.350 align:start position:0%
problems that we had for our first
prototypes<00:16:28.560><c> were</c><00:16:28.720><c> already</c><00:16:28.920><c> already</c><00:16:29.079><c> solved</c>

00:16:29.350 --> 00:16:29.360 align:start position:0%
prototypes were already already solved
 

00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:32.230 align:start position:0%
prototypes were already already solved
so<00:16:29.519><c> here</c><00:16:29.639><c> we</c><00:16:29.800><c> could</c><00:16:30.319><c> move</c><00:16:30.600><c> much</c><00:16:31.079><c> faster</c><00:16:32.079><c> and</c>

00:16:32.230 --> 00:16:32.240 align:start position:0%
so here we could move much faster and
 

00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:35.030 align:start position:0%
so here we could move much faster and
then<00:16:32.759><c> we</c><00:16:32.920><c> did</c><00:16:33.040><c> a</c><00:16:33.160><c> twoe</c><00:16:33.560><c> play</c><00:16:33.800><c> test</c><00:16:34.000><c> of</c><00:16:34.199><c> this</c><00:16:34.839><c> and</c>

00:16:35.030 --> 00:16:35.040 align:start position:0%
then we did a twoe play test of this and
 

00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:36.550 align:start position:0%
then we did a twoe play test of this and
it<00:16:35.160><c> was</c><00:16:35.360><c> really</c><00:16:35.519><c> fun</c><00:16:35.800><c> people</c><00:16:36.000><c> build</c><00:16:36.240><c> a</c><00:16:36.319><c> lot</c><00:16:36.440><c> of</c>

00:16:36.550 --> 00:16:36.560 align:start position:0%
it was really fun people build a lot of
 

00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:38.670 align:start position:0%
it was really fun people build a lot of

00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:40.670 align:start position:0%

some emerging drama there was uh one
 

00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:42.430 align:start position:0%

00:18:13.070 --> 00:18:13.080 align:start position:0%
entities are basically just IDs and then
 

00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:15.270 align:start position:0%
entities are basically just IDs and then
you<00:18:13.240><c> associate</c><00:18:13.760><c> data</c><00:18:14.080><c> with</c><00:18:14.240><c> them</c><00:18:14.559><c> with</c>

00:18:15.270 --> 00:18:15.280 align:start position:0%
you associate data with them with
 

00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:17.669 align:start position:0%
you associate data with them with
components<00:18:16.280><c> and</c><00:18:16.720><c> it</c><00:18:16.880><c> works</c><00:18:17.159><c> really</c><00:18:17.320><c> well</c><00:18:17.480><c> for</c>

00:18:17.669 --> 00:18:17.679 align:start position:0%
components and it works really well for
 

00:18:17.679 --> 00:18:19.190 align:start position:0%
components and it works really well for
something<00:18:17.960><c> like</c><00:18:18.159><c> position</c><00:18:18.679><c> you</c><00:18:18.760><c> can</c><00:18:18.919><c> have</c><00:18:19.039><c> a</c>

00:18:19.190 --> 00:18:19.200 align:start position:0%
something like position you can have a
 

00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:21.909 align:start position:0%
something like position you can have a

00:18:21.909 --> 00:18:21.919 align:start position:0%
position component and then each entity
 

00:18:21.919 --> 00:18:23.390 align:start position:0%
position component and then each entity
has<00:18:22.080><c> their</c><00:18:22.320><c> position</c><00:18:22.640><c> in</c><00:18:22.840><c> this</c><00:18:23.000><c> component</c>

00:18:23.390 --> 00:18:23.400 align:start position:0%
has their position in this component
 

00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:25.710 align:start position:0%
has their position in this component
works<00:18:23.679><c> well</c><00:18:24.400><c> but</c><00:18:24.600><c> then</c><00:18:25.120><c> for</c><00:18:25.320><c> something</c><00:18:25.559><c> like</c>

00:18:25.710 --> 00:18:25.720 align:start position:0%
works well but then for something like
 

00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:27.990 align:start position:0%
works well but then for something like
an<00:18:25.880><c> inventory</c><00:18:26.440><c> it's</c><00:18:26.600><c> much</c><00:18:26.799><c> trickier</c><00:18:27.400><c> because</c>

00:18:27.990 --> 00:18:28.000 align:start position:0%
an inventory it's much trickier because
 

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:29.669 align:start position:0%
an inventory it's much trickier because
you<00:18:28.200><c> have</c><00:18:28.360><c> to</c><00:18:28.960><c> you</c><00:18:29.080><c> know</c><00:18:29.320><c> you</c><00:18:29.440><c> have</c><00:18:29.520><c> to</c>

00:18:29.669 --> 00:18:29.679 align:start position:0%
you have to you know you have to
 

00:18:29.679 --> 00:18:31.350 align:start position:0%
you have to you know you have to
associate<00:18:30.200><c> everything</c><00:18:30.480><c> with</c><00:18:30.640><c> entities</c><00:18:31.159><c> so</c>

00:18:31.350 --> 00:18:31.360 align:start position:0%
associate everything with entities so
 

00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:32.870 align:start position:0%
associate everything with entities so
you<00:18:31.480><c> have</c><00:18:31.640><c> basically</c><00:18:32.000><c> have</c><00:18:32.159><c> two</c><00:18:32.400><c> options</c><00:18:32.720><c> for</c>

00:18:32.870 --> 00:18:32.880 align:start position:0%
you have basically have two options for
 

00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:35.430 align:start position:0%
you have basically have two options for
an<00:18:33.159><c> inventory</c><00:18:34.159><c> um</c><00:18:34.360><c> option</c><00:18:34.679><c> one</c><00:18:35.039><c> is</c><00:18:35.200><c> what</c><00:18:35.320><c> we</c>

00:18:35.430 --> 00:18:35.440 align:start position:0%
an inventory um option one is what we
 

00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:38.630 align:start position:0%
an inventory um option one is what we
used<00:18:35.679><c> for</c><00:18:36.000><c> opcraft</c><00:18:37.000><c> which</c><00:18:37.120><c> is</c><00:18:37.440><c> each</c><00:18:37.840><c> item</c><00:18:38.440><c> is</c>

00:18:38.630 --> 00:18:38.640 align:start position:0%
used for opcraft which is each item is
 

00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:40.430 align:start position:0%
used for opcraft which is each item is
its<00:18:38.799><c> own</c><00:18:39.039><c> entity</c><00:18:39.960><c> and</c><00:18:40.039><c> then</c><00:18:40.159><c> you</c><00:18:40.280><c> have</c>

00:18:40.430 --> 00:18:40.440 align:start position:0%
its own entity and then you have
 

00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:42.029 align:start position:0%
its own entity and then you have
something<00:18:40.720><c> like</c><00:18:40.840><c> an</c><00:18:40.960><c> owned</c><00:18:41.240><c> by</c><00:18:41.520><c> component</c>

00:18:42.029 --> 00:18:42.039 align:start position:0%
something like an owned by component
 

00:18:42.039 --> 00:18:44.350 align:start position:0%
something like an owned by component
which<00:18:42.280><c> basically</c><00:18:43.120><c> Associates</c><00:18:43.720><c> the</c><00:18:43.840><c> owner</c><00:18:44.200><c> of</c>

00:18:44.350 --> 00:18:44.360 align:start position:0%
which basically Associates the owner of
 

00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:46.909 align:start position:0%
which basically Associates the owner of
this<00:18:44.520><c> entity</c><00:18:45.360><c> with</c><00:18:45.520><c> the</c><00:18:45.679><c> enti</c><00:18:46.080><c> with</c><00:18:46.200><c> the</c><00:18:46.360><c> item</c>

00:18:46.909 --> 00:18:46.919 align:start position:0%
this entity with the enti with the item
 

00:18:46.919 --> 00:18:48.230 align:start position:0%
this entity with the enti with the item
and<00:18:47.000><c> then</c><00:18:47.120><c> you</c><00:18:47.200><c> model</c><00:18:47.480><c> the</c><00:18:47.600><c> inventory</c><00:18:48.080><c> that</c>

00:18:48.230 --> 00:18:48.240 align:start position:0%
and then you model the inventory that
 

00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:49.950 align:start position:0%
and then you model the inventory that

00:18:58.909 --> 00:18:58.919 align:start position:0%
bit more hacky um you can basically
 

00:18:58.919 --> 00:19:01.310 align:start position:0%

create<00:18:59.200><c> this</c><00:18:59.320><c> kind</c><00:18:59.440><c> of</c><00:18:59.600><c> pseudo</c><00:19:00.039><c> entity</c><00:19:00.919><c> by</c>

00:19:01.310 --> 00:19:01.320 align:start position:0%
create this kind of pseudo entity by
 

00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:02.950 align:start position:0%
create this kind of pseudo entity by
something<00:19:01.720><c> like</c><00:19:02.000><c> hashing</c><00:19:02.520><c> together</c><00:19:02.799><c> the</c>

00:19:02.950 --> 00:19:02.960 align:start position:0%
something like hashing together the

player and the item um and then that's
 

00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:07.190 align:start position:0%
player and the item um and then that's
your<00:19:05.880><c> entity</c><00:19:06.240><c> and</c><00:19:06.320><c> then</c><00:19:06.440><c> you</c><00:19:06.559><c> associate</c><00:19:07.039><c> the</c>

00:19:07.190 --> 00:19:07.200 align:start position:0%

00:19:16.590 --> 00:19:16.600 align:start position:0%
work with you know you have only still
 

00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:19.110 align:start position:0%
work with you know you have only still

00:19:20.470 --> 00:19:20.480 align:start position:0%
in the worst case it's a hash so you
 

00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:22.070 align:start position:0%
in the worst case it's a hash so you

00:19:22.070 --> 00:19:22.080 align:start position:0%
can't even really see what's the player
 

00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:24.149 align:start position:0%
can't even really see what's the player

00:19:24.149 --> 00:19:24.159 align:start position:0%
and what's the
 

00:19:24.159 --> 00:19:27.590 align:start position:0%
and what's the

00:19:27.590 --> 00:19:27.600 align:start position:0%

00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:30.230 align:start position:0%
entity then we um had a realization

00:19:30.230 --> 00:19:30.240 align:start position:0%
which is um ECS is basically just a
 

00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:31.789 align:start position:0%
which is um ECS is basically just a
subset<00:19:30.640><c> of</c><00:19:30.840><c> relational</c>

00:19:31.789 --> 00:19:31.799 align:start position:0%

00:19:31.799 --> 00:19:34.510 align:start position:0%

00:19:34.510 --> 00:19:34.520 align:start position:0%

00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:35.950 align:start position:0%
databases and um it has one limitation
which<00:19:34.640><c> is</c><00:19:34.799><c> the</c><00:19:34.919><c> entity</c><00:19:35.280><c> has</c><00:19:35.360><c> to</c><00:19:35.480><c> be</c><00:19:35.600><c> the</c><00:19:35.720><c> key</c>

00:19:35.950 --> 00:19:35.960 align:start position:0%
which is the entity has to be the key
 

00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:37.950 align:start position:0%
which is the entity has to be the key
table<00:19:36.600><c> which</c><00:19:36.840><c> made</c><00:19:37.159><c> modeling</c><00:19:37.559><c> something</c><00:19:37.840><c> like</c>

00:19:37.950 --> 00:19:37.960 align:start position:0%
table which made modeling something like
 

00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:40.070 align:start position:0%
table which made modeling something like
an<00:19:38.120><c> inventory</c><00:19:38.600><c> much</c>

00:19:40.070 --> 00:19:40.080 align:start position:0%
an inventory much
 

00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:42.830 align:start position:0%
an inventory much
easier<00:19:41.080><c> and</c><00:19:41.240><c> ECS</c><00:19:41.760><c> can</c><00:19:41.919><c> still</c><00:19:42.120><c> be</c><00:19:42.280><c> represented</c>

00:19:42.830 --> 00:19:42.840 align:start position:0%
easier and ECS can still be represented
 

00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:44.310 align:start position:0%
easier and ECS can still be represented
within<00:19:43.080><c> this</c><00:19:43.240><c> new</c><00:19:43.400><c> model</c><00:19:43.760><c> because</c><00:19:44.080><c> it's</c><00:19:44.200><c> a</c>

00:19:44.310 --> 00:19:44.320 align:start position:0%
within this new model because it's a
 

00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:46.950 align:start position:0%
within this new model because it's a
subset<00:19:45.320><c> so</c><00:19:45.480><c> you</c><00:19:45.600><c> can</c><00:19:45.760><c> now</c><00:19:46.039><c> have</c><00:19:46.520><c> uh</c><00:19:46.640><c> something</c>

00:19:46.950 --> 00:19:46.960 align:start position:0%
subset so you can now have uh something
 

00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:49.230 align:start position:0%
subset so you can now have uh something
like<00:19:47.120><c> the</c><00:19:47.240><c> position</c><00:19:47.559><c> table</c><00:19:47.840><c> still</c><00:19:48.559><c> um</c><00:19:48.760><c> just</c><00:19:49.039><c> by</c>

00:19:49.230 --> 00:19:49.240 align:start position:0%
like the position table still um just by
 

00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:52.149 align:start position:0%
like the position table still um just by

00:19:52.149 --> 00:19:52.159 align:start position:0%
using the entity as the only key that
 

00:19:52.159 --> 00:19:54.830 align:start position:0%
using the entity as the only key that
sounds<00:19:52.480><c> like</c><00:19:52.600><c> an</c><00:19:52.799><c> easy</c><00:19:53.039><c> change</c><00:19:54.000><c> but</c><00:19:54.480><c> it</c><00:19:54.600><c> was</c>

00:19:54.830 --> 00:19:54.840 align:start position:0%
sounds like an easy change but it was
 

00:19:54.840 --> 00:19:57.270 align:start position:0%
sounds like an easy change but it was
actually<00:19:55.159><c> much</c><00:19:56.039><c> harder</c><00:19:56.400><c> than</c><00:19:56.520><c> we</c><00:19:56.679><c> thought</c><00:19:57.159><c> um</c>

00:19:57.270 --> 00:19:57.280 align:start position:0%
actually much harder than we thought um
 

00:19:57.280 --> 00:19:59.190 align:start position:0%
actually much harder than we thought um
we<00:19:57.480><c> proposed</c><00:19:58.080><c> doing</c><00:19:58.400><c> this</c>

00:19:59.190 --> 00:19:59.200 align:start position:0%
we proposed doing this
 

00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:01.430 align:start position:0%
we proposed doing this
um<00:19:59.400><c> early</c><00:20:00.080><c> in</c>

00:20:01.430 --> 00:20:01.440 align:start position:0%
um early in
 

00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:04.190 align:start position:0%
um early in
2023<00:20:02.440><c> and</c><00:20:02.600><c> then</c><00:20:02.840><c> we</c><00:20:03.039><c> also</c><00:20:03.360><c> proposed</c><00:20:04.120><c> uh</c>

00:20:04.190 --> 00:20:04.200 align:start position:0%
2023 and then we also proposed uh
 

00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:05.669 align:start position:0%
2023 and then we also proposed uh
changing<00:20:04.600><c> the</c><00:20:04.720><c> world</c><00:20:04.919><c> framework</c><00:20:05.360><c> to</c><00:20:05.480><c> work</c>

00:20:05.669 --> 00:20:05.679 align:start position:0%
changing the world framework to work
 

00:20:05.679 --> 00:20:09.549 align:start position:0%
changing the world framework to work
better<00:20:05.919><c> with</c><00:20:06.039><c> the</c><00:20:06.159><c> STA</c><00:20:06.679><c> model</c><00:20:07.720><c> but</c><00:20:08.720><c> turns</c><00:20:09.039><c> out</c>

00:20:09.549 --> 00:20:09.559 align:start position:0%
better with the STA model but turns out
 

00:20:09.559 --> 00:20:11.149 align:start position:0%
better with the STA model but turns out
we<00:20:09.679><c> were</c><00:20:09.880><c> wrong</c><00:20:10.080><c> it</c><00:20:10.200><c> wasn't</c><00:20:10.440><c> just</c><00:20:10.520><c> a</c><00:20:10.640><c> 20-minute</c>

00:20:11.149 --> 00:20:11.159 align:start position:0%
we were wrong it wasn't just a 20-minute
 

00:20:11.159 --> 00:20:13.510 align:start position:0%
we were wrong it wasn't just a 20-minute
Adventure<00:20:11.679><c> it</c><00:20:11.840><c> almost</c><00:20:12.080><c> took</c><00:20:12.280><c> us</c><00:20:12.919><c> um</c><00:20:13.039><c> an</c><00:20:13.200><c> entire</c>

00:20:13.510 --> 00:20:13.520 align:start position:0%
Adventure it almost took us um an entire
 

00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:15.669 align:start position:0%
Adventure it almost took us um an entire
year<00:20:13.760><c> and</c><00:20:13.919><c> was</c><00:20:14.120><c> basically</c><00:20:14.400><c> a</c><00:20:14.520><c> full</c><00:20:14.799><c> rewrite</c><00:20:15.480><c> of</c>

00:30:45.990 --> 00:30:46.000 align:start position:0%
uh already there and then our basic unit
 

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:48.909 align:start position:0%
uh already there and then our basic unit
is<00:30:46.200><c> ft</c><00:30:46.640><c> and</c><00:30:46.799><c> ft</c><00:30:47.080><c> for</c><00:30:47.279><c> composability</c><00:30:47.919><c> yeah</c>

00:30:48.909 --> 00:30:48.919 align:start position:0%
is ft and ft for composability yeah

00:30:55.950 --> 00:30:55.960 align:start position:0%
the end we're going to make complex
 

00:30:55.960 --> 00:30:58.750 align:start position:0%
the end we're going to make complex
system<00:30:56.960><c> uh</c><00:30:57.120><c> that's</c><00:30:57.360><c> reduce</c><00:30:57.720><c> cost</c><00:30:58.200><c> it</c><00:30:58.360><c> deliver</c>

00:30:58.750 --> 00:30:58.760 align:start position:0%
system uh that's reduce cost it deliver
 

00:30:58.760 --> 00:31:01.789 align:start position:0%
system uh that's reduce cost it deliver
web<00:30:58.960><c> to</c><00:30:59.320><c> ux</c><00:31:00.320><c> and</c><00:31:00.480><c> then</c><00:31:01.039><c> since</c><00:31:01.360><c> we</c><00:31:01.519><c> know</c>

00:31:01.789 --> 00:31:01.799 align:start position:0%
web to ux and then since we know
 

00:31:01.799 --> 00:31:04.029 align:start position:0%
web to ux and then since we know
benefits<00:31:02.200><c> is</c><00:31:02.440><c> possible</c><00:31:03.080><c> so</c><00:31:03.440><c> you</c><00:31:03.679><c> know</c><00:31:03.880><c> that's</c>

00:31:04.029 --> 00:31:04.039 align:start position:0%
benefits is possible so you know that's
 

00:31:04.039 --> 00:31:07.149 align:start position:0%
benefits is possible so you know that's
the<00:31:04.200><c> extra</c><00:31:04.519><c> sugar</c><00:31:04.880><c> on</c><00:31:05.080><c> top</c><00:31:06.000><c> um</c><00:31:06.480><c> so</c><00:31:06.720><c> basically</c>

00:31:07.149 --> 00:31:07.159 align:start position:0%
the extra sugar on top um so basically
 

00:31:07.159 --> 00:31:09.750 align:start position:0%
the extra sugar on top um so basically
we're<00:31:07.399><c> making</c><00:31:07.639><c> an</c><00:31:08.159><c> onchain</c><00:31:08.639><c> RPG</c><00:31:09.080><c> Maker</c><00:31:09.480><c> for</c>

doing<00:32:02.519><c> this</c><00:32:02.799><c> isometric</c><00:32:03.360><c> transformation</c><00:32:03.840><c> it's</c>

00:32:04.149 --> 00:32:04.159 align:start position:0%
doing this isometric transformation it's
 

00:32:04.159 --> 00:32:07.590 align:start position:0%
doing this isometric transformation it's
the<00:32:04.360><c> same</c><00:32:04.720><c> anching</c><00:32:05.240><c> data</c><00:32:05.880><c> just</c><00:32:06.200><c> cats</c><00:32:07.200><c> and</c><00:32:07.360><c> then</c>

00:32:07.590 --> 00:32:07.600 align:start position:0%
the same anching data just cats and then
 

00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:10.070 align:start position:0%
the same anching data just cats and then
also<00:32:07.960><c> the</c><00:32:08.080><c> map</c><00:32:08.279><c> is</c><00:32:08.480><c> isometric</c><00:32:09.080><c> so</c><00:32:09.440><c> you</c><00:32:09.559><c> see</c><00:32:09.799><c> the</c>

00:32:10.070 --> 00:32:10.080 align:start position:0%
also the map is isometric so you see the
 

00:32:10.080 --> 00:32:11.990 align:start position:0%
also the map is isometric so you see the
previous<00:32:10.480><c> you</c><00:32:10.679><c> got</c><00:32:10.799><c> we</c><00:32:10.919><c> got</c><00:32:11.080><c> the</c><00:32:11.159><c> Rings</c><00:32:11.679><c> now</c>

00:32:11.990 --> 00:32:12.000 align:start position:0%
previous you got we got the Rings now
 

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:13.909 align:start position:0%
previous you got we got the Rings now
it's<00:32:12.240><c> the</c>

00:32:13.909 --> 00:32:13.919 align:start position:0%
it's the
 

00:32:13.919 --> 00:32:17.470 align:start position:0%
it's the
donut<00:32:14.919><c> um</c><00:32:15.440><c> then</c><00:32:16.200><c> uh</c><00:32:16.440><c> another</c><00:32:16.760><c> one</c><00:32:17.000><c> is</c><00:32:17.159><c> shoot</c>

00:32:17.470 --> 00:32:17.480 align:start position:0%
donut um then uh another one is shoot

00:52:29.789 --> 00:52:29.799 align:start position:0%
a so first of all we are getting the ABI
 

00:52:29.799 --> 00:52:34.549 align:start position:0%
a so first of all we are getting the ABI
from<00:52:30.040><c> the</c><00:52:30.400><c> mod</c><00:52:31.240><c> table</c><00:52:32.280><c> um</c><00:52:33.280><c> SC</c><00:52:33.880><c> and</c><00:52:33.960><c> so</c><00:52:34.119><c> we</c><00:52:34.240><c> match</c>

00:52:34.549 --> 00:52:34.559 align:start position:0%
from the mod table um SC and so we match
 

00:52:34.559 --> 00:52:36.829 align:start position:0%
from the mod table um SC and so we match
the<00:52:34.720><c> abis</c><00:52:35.440><c> and</c><00:52:35.760><c> combine</c>

00:52:36.829 --> 00:52:36.839 align:start position:0%
the abis and combine
 

00:52:36.839 --> 00:52:39.630 align:start position:0%

the um field names for example in the

00:52:42.309 --> 00:52:42.319 align:start position:0%

brain a while ago uh what I showed you
now<01:35:31.679><c> was</c><01:35:31.840><c> all</c><01:35:32.000><c> the</c><01:35:32.199><c> data</c><01:35:32.480><c> that</c><01:35:32.600><c> we've</c><01:35:32.840><c> indexed</c>

01:35:33.550 --> 01:35:33.560 align:start position:0%
now was all the data that we've indexed
 

01:35:33.560 --> 01:35:36.229 align:start position:0%
now was all the data that we've indexed
we've<01:35:33.840><c> then</c><01:35:34.280><c> be</c><01:35:34.560><c> we</c><01:35:34.719><c> able</c><01:35:34.920><c> to</c><01:35:35.159><c> query</c><01:35:35.600><c> it</c><01:35:35.960><c> plot</c>

01:35:36.229 --> 01:35:36.239 align:start position:0%
we've then be we able to query it plot
 

01:35:36.239 --> 01:35:37.830 align:start position:0%
we've then be we able to query it plot
it<01:35:36.360><c> into</c><01:35:36.600><c> charts</c><01:35:36.920><c> and</c><01:35:37.119><c> graphs</c><01:35:37.400><c> and</c><01:35:37.520><c> all</c><01:35:37.639><c> of</c>

01:35:37.830 --> 01:35:37.840 align:start position:0%
it into charts and graphs and all of
 

01:35:37.840 --> 01:35:39.669 align:start position:0%
it into charts and graphs and all of
that<01:35:38.520><c> I</c><01:35:38.600><c> want</c><01:35:38.719><c> to</c><01:35:38.800><c> show</c><01:35:38.960><c> you</c><01:35:39.080><c> something</c><01:35:39.360><c> else</c>

that I want to show you something else
interesting<01:35:40.679><c> so</c><01:35:41.000><c> what</c><01:35:41.159><c> we</c><01:35:41.280><c> did</c><01:35:41.520><c> was</c><01:35:41.760><c> we</c><01:35:41.920><c> built</c>

01:35:42.470 --> 01:35:42.480 align:start position:0%
interesting so what we did was we built
 

01:35:42.480 --> 01:35:46.910 align:start position:0%
interesting so what we did was we built
a<01:35:43.199><c> uh</c><01:35:43.440><c> a</c><01:35:43.679><c> time</c><01:35:43.960><c> travel</c><01:35:44.719><c> feature</c><01:35:45.199><c> for</c><01:35:46.000><c> um</c><01:35:46.639><c> for</c>

01:35:46.910 --> 01:35:46.920 align:start position:0%
a uh a time travel feature for um for
 

01:35:46.920 --> 01:35:49.870 align:start position:0%
a uh a time travel feature for um for
mud<01:35:47.719><c> mud</c><01:35:47.920><c> indexer</c><01:35:48.480><c> so</c><01:35:49.040><c> basically</c><01:35:49.520><c> what</c><01:35:49.719><c> you</c>

01:35:49.870 --> 01:35:49.880 align:start position:0%
mud mud indexer so basically what you
 

01:35:49.880 --> 01:35:52.870 align:start position:0%
mud mud indexer so basically what you
see<01:35:50.199><c> here</c><01:35:50.440><c> is</c><01:35:51.159><c> the</c><01:35:51.400><c> canvas</c><01:35:51.800><c> on</c><01:35:52.000><c> draw</c><01:35:52.360><c> Tech</c><01:35:52.719><c> when</c>

01:35:52.870 --> 01:35:52.880 align:start position:0%
see here is the canvas on draw Tech when
 

01:35:52.880 --> 01:35:55.550 align:start position:0%
see here is the canvas on draw Tech when
it<01:35:53.040><c> was</c><01:35:53.199><c> launched</c><01:35:53.719><c> this</c><01:35:53.840><c> was</c><01:35:53.920><c> a</c><01:35:54.119><c> first</c><01:35:54.560><c> block</c>

01:35:55.550 --> 01:35:55.560 align:start position:0%
it was launched this was a first block
 

01:35:55.560 --> 01:35:57.590 align:start position:0%
it was launched this was a first block
uh<01:35:56.199><c> this</c><01:35:56.320><c> is</c><01:35:56.480><c> probably</c><01:35:56.800><c> small</c><01:35:57.040><c> brain</c><01:35:57.320><c> Somebody</c>

01:35:57.590 --> 01:35:57.600 align:start position:0%
uh this is probably small brain Somebody
 

01:35:57.600 --> 01:35:59.550 align:start position:0%
uh this is probably small brain Somebody
went<01:35:57.800><c> in</c><01:35:57.920><c> and</c><01:35:58.119><c> tested</c><01:35:58.520><c> this</c><01:35:58.800><c> they</c><01:35:59.199><c> they</c><01:35:59.440><c> they</c>

01:35:59.550 --> 01:35:59.560 align:start position:0%
went in and tested this they they they
 

01:35:59.560 --> 01:36:02.470 align:start position:0%
went in and tested this they they they
put<01:35:59.719><c> a</c><01:35:59.840><c> tree</c><01:36:00.119><c> in</c><01:36:00.360><c> there</c><01:36:01.080><c> if</c><01:36:01.159><c> you</c><01:36:01.320><c> click</c><01:36:01.480><c> on</c><01:36:01.800><c> next</c>

01:36:02.470 --> 01:36:02.480 align:start position:0%
put a tree in there if you click on next
 

01:36:02.480 --> 01:36:04.149 align:start position:0%
put a tree in there if you click on next
what<01:36:02.560><c> it'll</c><01:36:02.800><c> do</c><01:36:03.000><c> is</c><01:36:03.119><c> it'll</c><01:36:03.320><c> fet</c><01:36:03.679><c> very</c><01:36:03.920><c> next</c>

01:36:04.149 --> 01:36:04.159 align:start position:0%
what it'll do is it'll fet very next
 

01:36:04.159 --> 01:36:06.830 align:start position:0%
what it'll do is it'll fet very next
block<01:36:04.440><c> so</c><01:36:04.639><c> it</c><01:36:04.800><c> this</c><01:36:04.880><c> is</c><01:36:05.040><c> all</c><01:36:05.800><c> um</c><01:36:06.159><c> using</c><01:36:06.480><c> a</c><01:36:06.639><c> mud</c>

01:36:06.830 --> 01:36:06.840 align:start position:0%

indexer<01:36:07.719><c> it</c><01:36:07.880><c> goes</c><01:36:08.119><c> to</c><01:36:08.639><c> uh</c><01:36:08.760><c> what</c><01:36:08.920><c> it</c><01:36:09.040><c> was</c><01:36:09.199><c> at</c><01:36:09.320><c> the</c>

01:36:09.470 --> 01:36:09.480 align:start position:0%
indexer it goes to uh what it was at the
 

01:36:09.480 --> 01:36:11.430 align:start position:0%
indexer it goes to uh what it was at the
point<01:36:09.760><c> point</c><01:36:09.960><c> in</c><01:36:10.199><c> time</c><01:36:10.480><c> or</c><01:36:10.679><c> rather</c><01:36:10.960><c> point</c><01:36:11.199><c> in</c>

in this game so first all the physics is
on<02:46:16.600><c> chain</c><02:46:16.920><c> so</c><02:46:17.120><c> jumps</c><02:46:17.439><c> movement</c><02:46:17.760><c> Etc</c><02:46:18.200><c> R</c><02:46:18.520><c> casting</c>

02:46:18.990 --> 02:46:19.000 align:start position:0%
on chain so jumps movement Etc R casting
 

02:46:19.000 --> 02:46:21.469 align:start position:0%
on chain so jumps movement Etc R casting
as<02:46:19.120><c> well</c><02:46:19.399><c> so</c><02:46:19.640><c> you</c><02:46:19.800><c> can't</c><02:46:20.040><c> just</c><02:46:20.279><c> like</c><02:46:20.960><c> declare</c>

02:46:21.469 --> 02:46:21.479 align:start position:0%
as well so you can't just like declare
 

02:46:21.479 --> 02:46:22.990 align:start position:0%
as well so you can't just like declare

actually had a lot of tricks to make it
 

02:46:30.200 --> 02:46:31.830 align:start position:0%
actually had a lot of tricks to make it
feel<02:46:30.439><c> good</c><02:46:30.760><c> this</c><02:46:30.920><c> doesn't</c><02:46:31.120><c> have</c><02:46:31.240><c> any</c><02:46:31.399><c> trick</c><02:46:31.680><c> as</c>

02:46:34.150 --> 02:46:34.160 align:start position:0%
all we just like removed a ton of code
 

02:46:34.160 --> 02:46:36.269 align:start position:0%
all we just like removed a ton of code

02:46:41.510 --> 02:46:41.520 align:start position:0%
now I want to talk a little bit about
 

02:46:41.520 --> 02:46:44.790 align:start position:0%
now I want to talk a little bit about
like<02:46:41.720><c> how</c><02:46:41.880><c> we</c><02:46:42.000><c> made</c><02:46:42.279><c> this</c><02:46:43.080><c> so</c><02:46:44.080><c> um</c><02:46:44.439><c> common</c>

02:46:44.790 --> 02:46:44.800 align:start position:0%
like how we made this so um common
 

02:46:44.800 --> 02:46:46.349 align:start position:0%
like how we made this so um common
across<02:46:45.080><c> the</c><02:46:45.200><c> three</c><02:46:45.479><c> projects</c><02:46:45.920><c> is</c><02:46:46.040><c> the</c><02:46:46.160><c> need</c>

02:46:46.349 --> 02:46:46.359 align:start position:0%
across the three projects is the need
 

02:46:46.359 --> 02:46:48.510 align:start position:0%
across the three projects is the need
for<02:46:46.640><c> low</c><02:46:46.960><c> latency</c><02:46:47.520><c> without</c><02:46:47.800><c> sacrificing</c><02:46:48.319><c> on</c>

02:46:48.510 --> 02:46:48.520 align:start position:0%

02:46:48.520 --> 02:46:49.950 align:start position:0%
for low latency without sacrificing on
boarding<02:46:49.040><c> so</c><02:46:49.160><c> we'll</c><02:46:49.359><c> talk</c><02:46:49.520><c> about</c><02:46:49.680><c> how</c><02:46:49.840><c> that</c>

02:46:49.950 --> 02:46:49.960 align:start position:0%
boarding so we'll talk about how that
 

02:46:49.960 --> 02:46:52.469 align:start position:0%
boarding so we'll talk about how that
works<02:46:50.279><c> so</c><02:46:50.600><c> this</c><02:46:50.760><c> is</c><02:46:51.359><c> um</c><02:46:51.560><c> a</c><02:46:51.720><c> traditional</c><02:46:52.240><c> block</c>

02:46:52.469 --> 02:46:52.479 align:start position:0%

it it gave us a gas allowance and then
 

02:56:46.439 --> 02:56:47.950 align:start position:0%
it it gave us a gas allowance and then
it's<02:56:46.560><c> setting</c><02:56:46.760><c> up</c><02:56:46.840><c> a</c><02:56:46.960><c> session</c><02:56:47.279><c> account</c><02:56:47.760><c> uh</c><02:56:47.880><c> the</c>

would<02:59:21.800><c> with</c><02:59:21.880><c> a</c><02:59:22.000><c> database</c><02:59:22.720><c> uh</c><02:59:22.800><c> you</c><02:59:22.920><c> have</c><02:59:23.279><c> a</c><02:59:23.399><c> list</c>

02:59:23.550 --> 02:59:23.560 align:start position:0%
would with a database uh you have a list
 

02:59:23.560 --> 02:59:24.750 align:start position:0%
would with a database uh you have a list
of<02:59:23.680><c> fields</c><02:59:23.920><c> in</c><02:59:24.040><c> your</c><02:59:24.160><c> schema</c><02:59:24.479><c> and</c><02:59:24.560><c> then</c><02:59:24.640><c> you</c>

02:59:24.750 --> 02:59:24.760 align:start position:0%
of fields in your schema and then you
 

02:59:24.760 --> 02:59:26.710 align:start position:0%
of fields in your schema and then you
define<02:59:25.200><c> basically</c><02:59:25.479><c> a</c><02:59:25.600><c> primary</c><02:59:26.120><c> primary</c><02:59:26.439><c> key</c>

02:59:26.710 --> 02:59:26.720 align:start position:0%
define basically a primary primary key
 

02:59:26.720 --> 02:59:29.150 align:start position:0%
define basically a primary primary key
which<02:59:26.880><c> can</c><02:59:27.000><c> be</c><02:59:27.160><c> one</c><02:59:27.319><c> or</c><02:59:27.479><c> more</c><02:59:27.800><c> Fields</c><02:59:28.800><c> uh</c><02:59:28.880><c> so</c><02:59:29.000><c> in</c>

02:59:29.150 --> 02:59:29.160 align:start position:0%
which can be one or more Fields uh so in
 

02:59:29.160 --> 02:59:31.190 align:start position:0%
which can be one or more Fields uh so in
here<02:59:29.439><c> we've</c><02:59:29.600><c> already</c><02:59:29.800><c> got</c><02:59:29.960><c> a</c><02:59:30.279><c> task</c><02:59:30.640><c> table</c><02:59:31.040><c> for</c>

02:59:31.190 --> 02:59:31.200 align:start position:0%
here we've already got a task table for
 

02:59:31.200 --> 02:59:33.870 align:start position:0%
here we've already got a task table for
our<02:59:31.319><c> to-do</c><02:59:31.640><c> list</c><02:59:31.840><c> app</c><02:59:32.720><c> um</c><02:59:32.920><c> next</c><02:59:33.399><c> for</c><02:59:33.560><c> our</c><02:59:33.720><c> game</c>

02:59:33.870 --> 02:59:33.880 align:start position:0%
our to-do list app um next for our game
 

02:59:33.880 --> 02:59:35.429 align:start position:0%
our to-do list app um next for our game
we're<02:59:34.080><c> going</c><02:59:34.160><c> to</c><02:59:34.239><c> add</c><02:59:34.359><c> a</c><02:59:34.520><c> position</c><02:59:34.840><c> table</c><02:59:35.200><c> so</c>

02:59:35.429 --> 02:59:35.439 align:start position:0%
we're going to add a position table so
 

02:59:35.439 --> 02:59:37.070 align:start position:0%
we're going to add a position table so
every<02:59:35.680><c> player</c><02:59:36.160><c> has</c><02:59:36.279><c> a</c><02:59:36.399><c> position</c><02:59:36.680><c> on</c><02:59:36.800><c> the</c><02:59:36.920><c> map</c>

02:59:37.070 --> 02:59:37.080 align:start position:0%
every player has a position on the map
 

02:59:37.080 --> 02:59:39.429 align:start position:0%
every player has a position on the map
and<02:59:37.160><c> they</c><02:59:37.279><c> can</c><02:59:37.359><c> move</c><02:59:37.760><c> around</c><02:59:38.760><c> uh</c><02:59:39.000><c> so</c><02:59:39.160><c> we'll</c><02:59:39.319><c> do</c>

02:59:39.429 --> 02:59:39.439 align:start position:0%
and they can move around uh so we'll do
 

02:59:39.439 --> 02:59:40.469 align:start position:0%
and they can move around uh so we'll do
that

02:59:40.469 --> 02:59:40.479 align:start position:0%
that
 

02:59:40.479 --> 02:59:42.910 align:start position:0%
that
here

02:59:42.910 --> 02:59:42.920 align:start position:0%
here
 

02:59:42.920 --> 02:59:46.790 align:start position:0%
here
schema<02:59:43.920><c> so</c><02:59:44.120><c> the</c><02:59:44.239><c> first</c><02:59:44.680><c> thing</c><02:59:44.880><c> we</c><02:59:45.000><c> want</c><02:59:45.279><c> is</c><02:59:45.560><c> a</c>

02:59:46.790 --> 02:59:46.800 align:start position:0%
schema so the first thing we want is a
 

02:59:46.800 --> 02:59:49.990 align:start position:0%
schema so the first thing we want is a
player<02:59:47.800><c> um</c><02:59:48.160><c> this</c><02:59:48.279><c> will</c><02:59:48.439><c> be</c><02:59:49.200><c> one</c><02:59:49.479><c> position</c><02:59:49.800><c> per</c>

02:59:49.990 --> 02:59:50.000 align:start position:0%
player um this will be one position per
 

02:59:50.000 --> 02:59:52.070 align:start position:0%
player um this will be one position per
player<02:59:50.840><c> and</c><02:59:50.920><c> then</c><02:59:51.040><c> we'll</c><02:59:51.200><c> have</c><02:59:51.319><c> an</c><02:59:51.439><c> next</c><02:59:51.760><c> X</c><02:59:51.880><c> and</c>

02:59:52.070 --> 02:59:52.080 align:start position:0%
player and then we'll have an next X and
 

02:59:52.080 --> 02:59:56.349 align:start position:0%
player and then we'll have an next X and
Y

02:59:56.349 --> 02:59:56.359 align:start position:0%
 
 

02:59:56.359 --> 02:59:58.309 align:start position:0%

02:59:58.309 --> 02:59:58.319 align:start position:0%
coordinate uh and then our our
 

02:59:58.319 --> 02:59:59.950 align:start position:0%
coordinate uh and then our our
typescript<02:59:58.800><c> is</c><02:59:58.920><c> telling</c><02:59:59.200><c> us</c><02:59:59.560><c> um</c><02:59:59.720><c> everything</c>

02:59:59.950 --> 02:59:59.960 align:start position:0%
typescript is telling us um everything
 

02:59:59.960 --> 03:00:01.550 align:start position:0%

03:00:01.550 --> 03:00:01.560 align:start position:0%
in mud is strongly typed um so
 

03:00:01.560 --> 03:00:02.870 align:start position:0%
in mud is strongly typed um so
typescript<03:00:01.960><c> is</c><03:00:02.040><c> telling</c><03:00:02.239><c> us</c><03:00:02.319><c> we're</c><03:00:02.439><c> missing</c><03:00:02.680><c> a</c>

03:00:02.870 --> 03:00:02.880 align:start position:0%
typescript is telling us we're missing a

typescript is telling us we're missing a

03:00:06.710 --> 03:00:06.720 align:start position:0%

03:00:18.550 --> 03:00:18.560 align:start position:0%
actually rebuilding the project
 

03:00:18.560 --> 03:00:21.830 align:start position:0%
actually rebuilding the project
um<03:00:19.200><c> so</c><03:00:19.359><c> if</c><03:00:19.439><c> we</c><03:00:19.600><c> look</c><03:00:19.760><c> at</c><03:00:20.000><c> our</c><03:00:20.880><c> uh</c><03:00:21.200><c> Dev</c><03:00:21.479><c> contract</c>

03:00:21.830 --> 03:00:21.840 align:start position:0%
um so if we look at our uh Dev contract
 

03:00:21.840 --> 03:00:24.590 align:start position:0%
um so if we look at our uh Dev contract
script<03:00:22.359><c> again</c><03:00:23.279><c> um</c><03:00:23.479><c> it</c><03:00:23.680><c> recognized</c><03:00:24.359><c> that</c><03:00:24.479><c> there</c>

03:00:24.590 --> 03:00:24.600 align:start position:0%
script again um it recognized that there
 

03:00:24.600 --> 03:00:26.710 align:start position:0%
script again um it recognized that there
was<03:00:24.680><c> a</c><03:00:24.800><c> file</c><03:00:25.040><c> change</c><03:00:25.279><c> in</c><03:00:25.399><c> the</c><03:00:25.520><c> config</c><03:00:26.479><c> uh</c><03:00:26.560><c> it</c>

03:00:26.710 --> 03:00:26.720 align:start position:0%
was a file change in the config uh it
 

03:00:26.720 --> 03:00:28.670 align:start position:0%
was a file change in the config uh it
reran<03:00:27.160><c> the</c><03:00:27.279><c> dev</c>

and<03:14:32.239><c> build</c><03:14:32.439><c> a</c><03:14:32.600><c> meta</c><03:14:32.960><c> framework</c><03:14:33.479><c> over</c><03:14:33.680><c> it</c><03:14:33.920><c> like</c>

03:14:34.110 --> 03:14:34.120 align:start position:0%
and build a meta framework over it like
 

03:14:34.120 --> 03:14:35.309 align:start position:0%
and build a meta framework over it like
react<03:14:34.479><c> and</c>

next uh I'm not mud so we build a lot of
 

03:14:41.239 --> 03:14:43.590 align:start position:0%
next uh I'm not mud so we build a lot of
in<03:14:41.399><c> addition</c><03:14:41.720><c> to</c><03:14:42.080><c> the</c><03:14:42.560><c> the</c><03:14:42.720><c> solidity</c><03:14:43.239><c> side</c><03:14:43.479><c> we</c>

03:14:45.550 --> 03:14:45.560 align:start position:0%
build a lot of JavaScript tooling um so
 

03:14:45.560 --> 03:14:47.030 align:start position:0%
build a lot of JavaScript tooling um so
it<03:14:45.680><c> kind</c><03:14:45.800><c> of</c><03:14:45.960><c> is</c><03:14:46.080><c> already</c><03:14:46.319><c> doing</c><03:14:46.560><c> this</c><03:14:46.760><c> it's</c>

03:32:16.590 --> 03:32:16.600 align:start position:0%
up what a lot of people are building um
 

03:32:16.600 --> 03:32:18.590 align:start position:0%
up what a lot of people are building um
so<03:32:16.840><c> it</c><03:32:16.960><c> does</c><03:32:17.160><c> make</c><03:32:17.279><c> it</c><03:32:17.560><c> high</c><03:32:17.800><c> stakes</c><03:32:18.160><c> you</c><03:32:18.279><c> need</c>

03:40:40.950 --> 03:40:40.960 align:start position:0%
this is a web H application so it looks
 

03:40:40.960 --> 03:40:44.990 align:start position:0%
this is a web H application so it looks
much<03:40:41.239><c> better</c><03:40:41.720><c> as</c><03:40:41.920><c> a</c><03:40:42.359><c> Unity</c><03:40:43.359><c> site</c><03:40:44.199><c> and</c><03:40:44.399><c> so</c><03:40:44.840><c> here</c>

03:40:44.990 --> 03:40:45.000 align:start position:0%
much better as a Unity site and so here
 

03:40:45.000 --> 03:40:47.630 align:start position:0%
much better as a Unity site and so here
we<03:40:45.080><c> can</c><03:40:45.399><c> see</c><03:40:45.680><c> exactly</c><03:40:46.160><c> the</c><03:40:46.279><c> same</c><03:40:46.560><c> view</c><03:40:47.319><c> but</c>

03:40:47.630 --> 03:40:47.640 align:start position:0%
we can see exactly the same view but
 

03:40:47.640 --> 03:40:50.670 align:start position:0%
we can see exactly the same view but
actually<03:40:48.040><c> in</c><03:40:48.239><c> unity</c><03:40:48.760><c> so</c><03:40:49.319><c> yeah</c><03:40:49.600><c> it</c><03:40:49.760><c> looks</c><03:40:50.319><c> much</c>

03:40:50.670 --> 03:40:50.680 align:start position:0%
actually in unity so yeah it looks much
 

03:40:50.680 --> 03:40:54.630 align:start position:0%
actually in unity so yeah it looks much
much<03:40:50.920><c> better</c><03:40:51.279><c> than</c><03:40:51.800><c> HTML</c><03:40:52.840><c> version</c><03:40:53.840><c> um</c><03:40:54.160><c> so</c><03:40:54.399><c> how</c>

03:40:54.630 --> 03:40:54.640 align:start position:0%
much better than HTML version um so how
 

03:40:54.640 --> 03:40:58.030 align:start position:0%
much better than HTML version um so how
does<03:40:54.800><c> it</c><03:40:55.040><c> work</c><03:40:56.080><c> underneath</c><03:40:57.080><c> uh</c><03:40:57.399><c> here</c><03:40:57.560><c> is</c><03:40:57.800><c> got</c><03:40:57.920><c> a</c>

03:41:38.070 --> 03:41:38.080 align:start position:0%
see how we can create a net integration
 

03:41:38.080 --> 03:41:40.630 align:start position:0%
see how we can create a net integration
test<03:41:38.399><c> and</c><03:41:38.560><c> obviously</c><03:41:39.000><c> deploy</c><03:41:39.439><c> it</c><03:41:39.600><c> using</c><03:41:39.920><c> do</c>

03:41:40.630 --> 03:41:40.640 align:start position:0%
test and obviously deploy it using do
 

03:41:40.640 --> 03:41:43.910 align:start position:0%
test and obviously deploy it using do
net<03:41:41.640><c> so</c><03:41:42.159><c> let's</c><03:41:42.399><c> see</c><03:41:42.840><c> how</c><03:41:43.080><c> this</c><03:41:43.279><c> work</c><03:41:43.680><c> if</c><03:41:43.800><c> we</c>

03:41:43.910 --> 03:41:43.920 align:start position:0%
net so let's see how this work if we
 

03:41:43.920 --> 03:41:45.349 align:start position:0%
net so let's see how this work if we
were<03:41:44.120><c> adding</c><03:41:44.439><c> some</c><03:41:44.600><c> functionality</c><03:41:45.080><c> to</c><03:41:45.239><c> to</c>

created a catalog yeah so let's start
 

03:42:20.199 --> 03:42:22.110 align:start position:0%
created a catalog yeah so let's start
how<03:42:20.359><c> will</c><03:42:20.479><c> it</c><03:42:20.640><c> look</c><03:42:20.840><c> like</c><03:42:21.359><c> so</c><03:42:21.600><c> let's</c><03:42:21.840><c> start</c>

03:42:22.110 --> 03:42:22.120 align:start position:0%
how will it look like so let's start
 

03:42:22.120 --> 03:42:25.309 align:start position:0%
how will it look like so let's start
with<03:42:22.319><c> the</c><03:42:22.640><c> smart</c><03:42:23.000><c> contract</c><03:42:23.680><c> tracks</c><03:42:24.680><c> so</c><03:42:25.120><c> first</c>

03:42:25.309 --> 03:42:25.319 align:start position:0%
with the smart contract tracks so first

03:43:04.319 --> 03:43:07.149 align:start position:0%
working with it so how as you can see
here<03:43:04.479><c> we</c><03:43:04.640><c> got</c><03:43:04.960><c> the</c><03:43:05.319><c> a</c><03:43:05.439><c> new</c><03:43:05.720><c> catalog</c><03:43:06.279><c> system</c><03:43:07.040><c> and</c>

03:43:07.149 --> 03:43:07.159 align:start position:0%
here we got the a new catalog system and
 

03:43:07.159 --> 03:43:10.189 align:start position:0%
here we got the a new catalog system and
then<03:43:07.319><c> we</c><03:43:07.439><c> can</c><03:43:07.600><c> access</c><03:43:07.920><c> the</c><03:43:08.080><c> data</c>

03:43:10.189 --> 03:43:10.199 align:start position:0%
then we can access the data
 

03:43:10.199 --> 03:43:13.469 align:start position:0%
then we can access the data
there<03:43:11.199><c> for</c><03:43:11.399><c> the</c><03:43:11.560><c> cut</c><03:43:11.840><c> item</c><03:43:12.199><c> then</c><03:43:12.359><c> now</c><03:43:12.560><c> we</c><03:43:12.720><c> have</c>

03:43:13.469 --> 03:43:13.479 align:start position:0%
there for the cut item then now we have
 

03:43:13.479 --> 03:43:16.870 align:start position:0%
there for the cut item then now we have
cut<03:43:14.000><c> the</c><03:43:14.199><c> price</c><03:43:14.640><c> Etc</c><03:43:15.600><c> and</c><03:43:15.760><c> then</c><03:43:16.120><c> it</c><03:43:16.279><c> this</c>

03:43:16.870 --> 03:43:16.880 align:start position:0%
cut the price Etc and then it this
 

03:43:16.880 --> 03:43:20.510 align:start position:0%
cut the price Etc and then it this
integrates<03:43:17.880><c> where</c><03:43:18.880><c> our</c><03:43:19.359><c> other</c><03:43:19.720><c> Library</c><03:43:20.239><c> so</c><03:43:20.439><c> we</c>

03:43:20.510 --> 03:43:20.520 align:start position:0%
integrates where our other Library so we
 

03:43:20.520 --> 03:43:22.030 align:start position:0%
integrates where our other Library so we
can<03:43:20.680><c> get</c><03:43:20.800><c> the</c><03:43:20.960><c> token</c><03:43:21.239><c> balance</c><03:43:21.600><c> that</c><03:43:21.720><c> we</c><03:43:21.880><c> have</c>

03:43:22.030 --> 03:43:22.040 align:start position:0%
can get the token balance that we have
 

03:43:22.040 --> 03:43:23.790 align:start position:0%
can get the token balance that we have
so<03:43:22.199><c> we</c><03:43:22.319><c> can</c><03:43:22.479><c> do</c><03:43:22.600><c> the</c><03:43:22.720><c> purchas</c><03:43:23.080><c> it</c><03:43:23.239><c> and</c>

03:43:23.790 --> 03:43:23.800 align:start position:0%
so we can do the purchas it and
 

03:43:23.800 --> 03:43:27.030 align:start position:0%
so we can do the purchas it and
validated<03:43:24.960><c> so</c><03:43:25.960><c> now</c><03:43:26.120><c> we</c><03:43:26.319><c> got</c><03:43:26.479><c> our</c><03:43:26.720><c> system</c>

03:43:27.030 --> 03:43:27.040 align:start position:0%
validated so now we got our system
 

03:43:27.040 --> 03:43:30.309 align:start position:0%
validated so now we got our system
created<03:43:27.840><c> what</c><03:43:27.960><c> we're</c><03:43:28.120><c> going</c><03:43:28.239><c> to</c><03:43:28.399><c> do</c><03:43:29.239><c> um</c><03:43:29.680><c> so</c>

03:43:30.309 --> 03:43:30.319 align:start position:0%
created what we're going to do um so
 

03:43:30.319 --> 03:43:33.070 align:start position:0%
created what we're going to do um so
ethereum<03:43:30.840><c> now</c><03:43:31.199><c> includes</c><03:43:31.720><c> a</c><03:43:32.000><c> a</c><03:43:32.239><c> new</c><03:43:32.680><c> code</c>

03:45:48.950 --> 03:45:48.960 align:start position:0%
and let's have a look how will this will
 

03:45:48.960 --> 03:45:51.590 align:start position:0%
and let's have a look how will this will
look<03:45:49.199><c> in</c><03:45:49.399><c> the</c><03:45:49.680><c> in</c><03:45:49.760><c> the</c><03:45:50.080><c> database</c>

03:45:51.590 --> 03:45:51.600 align:start position:0%
look in the in the database
 

03:45:51.600 --> 03:45:56.590 align:start position:0%
look in the in the database
so<03:45:52.600><c> neum</c><03:45:53.279><c> now</c><03:45:53.760><c> also</c><03:45:54.239><c> includes</c><03:45:55.239><c> a</c><03:45:56.080><c> ethereum</c>

recreated so we that was the data so
 

03:47:37.760 --> 03:47:39.830 align:start position:0%
recreated so we that was the data so
what<03:47:37.960><c> happens</c><03:47:38.359><c> next</c><03:47:38.920><c> you</c><03:47:39.040><c> know</c><03:47:39.279><c> let's</c><03:47:39.479><c> look</c><03:47:39.640><c> at</c>

03:47:39.830 --> 03:47:39.840 align:start position:0%
what happens next you know let's look at
 

03:47:39.840 --> 03:47:42.389 align:start position:0%
what happens next you know let's look at

question<03:56:50.600><c> from</c><03:56:50.760><c> the</c><03:56:50.840><c> audience</c><03:56:51.319><c> which</c><03:56:51.439><c> is</c><03:56:52.000><c> how</c>

03:56:52.229 --> 03:56:52.239 align:start position:0%
question from the audience which is how
 

03:56:52.239 --> 03:56:54.469 align:start position:0%
question from the audience which is how
do<03:56:52.319><c> you</c><03:56:52.439><c> prevent</c><03:56:52.800><c> it</c><03:56:52.960><c> to</c><03:56:53.640><c> the</c><03:56:53.760><c> stale</c><03:56:54.159><c> game</c><03:56:54.359><c> of</c>

03:56:54.469 --> 03:56:54.479 align:start position:0%
do you prevent it to the stale game of
 

03:56:54.479 --> 03:56:56.149 align:start position:0%
do you prevent it to the stale game of
the<03:56:54.640><c> state</c><03:56:55.040><c> to</c><03:56:55.319><c> to</c><03:56:55.399><c> the</c><03:56:55.520><c> stale</c><03:56:55.760><c> game</c><03:56:55.920><c> state</c>

03:56:56.149 --> 03:56:56.159 align:start position:0%
the state to to the stale game state
 

03:56:56.159 --> 03:56:57.510 align:start position:0%
the state to to the stale game state
that<03:56:56.239><c> there's</c><03:56:56.439><c> hundreds</c><03:56:56.720><c> of</c><03:56:56.840><c> players</c><03:56:57.080><c> in</c><03:56:57.199><c> the</c>

03:56:57.510 --> 03:56:57.520 align:start position:0%
that there's hundreds of players in the
 

03:56:57.520 --> 03:57:00.830 align:start position:0%
that there's hundreds of players in the
world<03:56:58.520><c> right</c><03:56:59.080><c> uh</c><03:56:59.600><c> obviously</c><03:57:00.120><c> the</c><03:57:00.399><c> example</c>

03:57:00.830 --> 03:57:00.840 align:start position:0%
world right uh obviously the example
 

03:57:00.840 --> 03:57:03.429 align:start position:0%
world right uh obviously the example
that<03:57:01.080><c> example</c><03:57:01.520><c> is</c><03:57:01.720><c> a</c><03:57:01.920><c> for</c><03:57:02.359><c> a</c><03:57:02.439><c> single</c><03:57:02.800><c> player</c>

03:57:03.429 --> 03:57:03.439 align:start position:0%
that example is a for a single player
 

03:57:03.439 --> 03:57:05.309 align:start position:0%
that example is a for a single player
within<03:57:03.880><c> your</c><03:57:04.159><c> confined</c><03:57:04.640><c> line</c><03:57:04.960><c> so</c><03:57:05.120><c> it's</c>

03:57:05.309 --> 03:57:05.319 align:start position:0%
within your confined line so it's
 

03:57:05.319 --> 03:57:07.750 align:start position:0%
within your confined line so it's
obviously<03:57:05.800><c> this</c><03:57:05.880><c> is</c><03:57:06.040><c> no</c><03:57:06.319><c> Bas</c><03:57:06.479><c> on</c><03:57:06.680><c> a</c>

03:57:07.750 --> 03:57:07.760 align:start position:0%
obviously this is no Bas on a
 

03:57:07.760 --> 03:57:12.910 align:start position:0%
obviously this is no Bas on a
multiplayer<03:57:08.760><c> enironment</c><03:57:09.760><c> uh</c><03:57:10.600><c> so</c><03:57:11.600><c> H</c><03:57:12.399><c> for</c><03:57:12.640><c> that</c>

03:57:12.910 --> 03:57:12.920 align:start position:0%
multiplayer enironment uh so H for that
 

03:57:12.920 --> 03:57:14.790 align:start position:0%
multiplayer enironment uh so H for that
we<03:57:13.159><c> have</c><03:57:13.279><c> to</c><03:57:13.399><c> think</c><03:57:13.600><c> about</c><03:57:13.760><c> it</c><03:57:13.880><c> so</c>

03:57:14.790 --> 03:57:14.800 align:start position:0%
we have to think about it so
 

03:57:14.800 --> 03:57:17.269 align:start position:0%
we have to think about it so
it<03:57:14.920><c> will</c><03:57:15.159><c> be</c><03:57:15.600><c> you</c><03:57:15.760><c> will</c><03:57:16.000><c> have</c><03:57:16.120><c> to</c><03:57:16.359><c> think</c><03:57:16.680><c> about</c>

03:57:17.269 --> 03:57:17.279 align:start position:0%
it will be you will have to think about
 

03:57:17.279 --> 03:57:20.189 align:start position:0%
it will be you will have to think about
how<03:57:17.399><c> to</c><03:57:17.800><c> delimitate</c><03:57:18.720><c> the</c><03:57:19.000><c> that</c><03:57:19.439><c> part</c><03:57:19.800><c> of</c><03:57:20.000><c> the</c>

03:57:20.189 --> 03:57:20.199 align:start position:0%
how to delimitate the that part of the
 

03:57:20.199 --> 03:57:22.269 align:start position:0%
how to delimitate the that part of the
data<03:57:20.880><c> and</c><03:57:21.080><c> so</c><03:57:21.199><c> if</c><03:57:21.279><c> you</c><03:57:21.399><c> don't</c><03:57:21.640><c> really</c><03:57:21.800><c> want</c><03:57:21.960><c> to</c>

03:57:22.269 --> 03:57:22.279 align:start position:0%
data and so if you don't really want to
 

03:57:22.279 --> 03:57:24.149 align:start position:0%
data and so if you don't really want to
constantly<03:57:22.760><c> SN</c><03:57:23.159><c> and</c><03:57:23.279><c> then</c><03:57:23.399><c> say</c><03:57:23.600><c> like</c><03:57:23.840><c> hey</c><03:57:24.040><c> you</c>

03:57:24.149 --> 03:57:24.159 align:start position:0%
constantly SN and then say like hey you
 

03:57:24.159 --> 03:57:26.630 align:start position:0%
constantly SN and then say like hey you
know<03:57:24.359><c> this</c><03:57:24.520><c> por</c><03:57:24.800><c> is</c><03:57:24.920><c> where</c><03:57:25.120><c> you</c><03:57:25.279><c> working</c><03:57:26.120><c> yeah</c>

03:57:26.630 --> 03:57:26.640 align:start position:0%
know this por is where you working yeah
 

03:57:26.640 --> 03:57:28.870 align:start position:0%
know this por is where you working yeah
and<03:57:26.800><c> then</c><03:57:27.319><c> and</c><03:57:27.520><c> then</c><03:57:28.000><c> and</c><03:57:28.239><c> then</c><03:57:28.439><c> that</c><03:57:28.640><c> way</c>

03:57:28.870 --> 03:57:28.880 align:start position:0%
and then and then and then that way
 

03:57:28.880 --> 03:57:31.389 align:start position:0%
and then and then and then that way
allows<03:57:29.159><c> you</c><03:57:29.319><c> to</c><03:57:30.000><c> keep</c><03:57:30.279><c> that</c>

03:57:31.389 --> 03:57:31.399 align:start position:0%
allows you to keep that
 

03:57:31.399 --> 03:57:34.030 align:start position:0%
allows you to keep that
data<03:57:32.399><c> without</c><03:57:32.680><c> saving</c><03:57:33.040><c> all</c><03:57:33.199><c> the</c><03:57:33.359><c> time</c>

03:57:34.030 --> 03:57:34.040 align:start position:0%
data without saving all the time
 

03:57:34.040 --> 03:57:37.030 align:start position:0%
data without saving all the time
obviously<03:57:34.680><c> the</c><03:57:34.800><c> other</c><03:57:35.040><c> solution</c><03:57:35.399><c> is</c><03:57:36.040><c> like</c>

03:57:37.030 --> 03:57:37.040 align:start position:0%
obviously the other solution is like
 

03:57:37.040 --> 03:57:40.550 align:start position:0%
obviously the other solution is like
conly<03:57:37.520><c> constantly</c><03:57:37.840><c> sing</c><03:57:38.319><c> Etc</c><03:57:39.080><c> but</c><03:57:40.080><c> you</c><03:57:40.319><c> if</c><03:57:40.399><c> you</c>

03:57:40.550 --> 03:57:40.560 align:start position:0%
conly constantly sing Etc but you if you
 

03:57:40.560 --> 03:57:43.269 align:start position:0%
conly constantly sing Etc but you if you
got<03:57:40.760><c> millions</c><03:57:41.080><c> of</c><03:57:41.520><c> users</c><03:57:42.520><c> you</c><03:57:42.760><c> always</c>

03:57:43.269 --> 03:57:43.279 align:start position:0%
got millions of users you always
 

03:57:43.279 --> 03:57:44.630 align:start position:0%
got millions of users you always
eventually<03:57:43.720><c> you're</c><03:57:43.840><c> going</c><03:57:43.920><c> to</c><03:57:44.040><c> get</c><03:57:44.319><c> some</c>

03:57:44.630 --> 03:57:44.640 align:start position:0%
eventually you're going to get some
 

03:57:44.640 --> 03:57:46.590 align:start position:0%
eventually you're going to get some
scalability<03:57:45.640><c> yeah</c><03:57:45.880><c> yeah</c><03:57:46.080><c> I</c><03:57:46.159><c> mean</c><03:57:46.319><c> here</c><03:57:46.439><c> it's</c>

03:57:46.590 --> 03:57:46.600 align:start position:0%
scalability yeah yeah I mean here it's
 

03:57:46.600 --> 03:57:48.229 align:start position:0%
scalability yeah yeah I mean here it's
because<03:57:46.840><c> each</c><03:57:47.000><c> player</c><03:57:47.239><c> has</c><03:57:47.359><c> a</c><03:57:47.479><c> lock</c><03:57:47.880><c> on</c><03:57:48.080><c> their</c>

03:57:48.229 --> 03:57:48.239 align:start position:0%
because each player has a lock on their
 

03:57:48.239 --> 03:57:49.830 align:start position:0%
because each player has a lock on their
land<03:57:48.600><c> essentially</c><03:57:49.080><c> so</c><03:57:49.239><c> that's</c><03:57:49.399><c> why</c><03:57:49.560><c> they</c><03:57:49.680><c> can</c>

03:57:49.830 --> 03:57:49.840 align:start position:0%
land essentially so that's why they can
 

03:57:49.840 --> 03:57:52.229 align:start position:0%
land essentially so that's why they can
work<03:57:50.159><c> offline</c><03:57:50.800><c> okay</c><03:57:51.000><c> makes</c><03:57:51.239><c> sense</c><03:57:51.920><c> uh</c><03:57:52.040><c> we</c><03:57:52.120><c> have</c>

03:57:52.229 --> 03:57:52.239 align:start position:0%
work offline okay makes sense uh we have
 

03:57:52.239 --> 03:57:53.670 align:start position:0%
work offline okay makes sense uh we have
another<03:57:52.520><c> question</c><03:57:52.760><c> here</c><03:57:52.960><c> which</c><03:57:53.080><c> is</c><03:57:53.279><c> are</c><03:57:53.439><c> you</c>

to use your mic yeah what do you think

to use your mic yeah what do you think
yeah<04:04:39.720><c> so</c><04:04:40.040><c> mine</c><04:04:40.199><c> is</c><04:04:40.399><c> kind</c><04:04:40.479><c> of</c><04:04:40.600><c> a</c><04:04:40.680><c> Brute</c><04:04:40.960><c> Force</c>

04:04:41.349 --> 04:04:41.359 align:start position:0%
yeah so mine is kind of a Brute Force
 

04:04:41.359 --> 04:04:43.389 align:start position:0%
yeah so mine is kind of a Brute Force
but<04:04:41.520><c> what</c><04:04:41.600><c> you</c><04:04:41.720><c> do</c><04:04:42.080><c> is</c><04:04:42.239><c> you</c><04:04:42.479><c> hash</c><04:04:42.760><c> to</c><04:04:42.920><c> SEC</c><04:04:43.319><c> a</c>

04:04:43.389 --> 04:04:43.399 align:start position:0%
but what you do is you hash to SEC a
 

04:04:43.399 --> 04:04:45.269 align:start position:0%
but what you do is you hash to SEC a
simp<04:04:43.840><c> zkp</c><04:04:44.359><c> that</c><04:04:44.439><c> you</c><04:04:44.560><c> know</c><04:04:44.680><c> the</c><04:04:44.760><c> pre-image</c><04:04:45.159><c> of</c>

04:04:47.030 --> 04:04:47.040 align:start position:0%
the hash but it's kind of Brute Force I
 

04:04:47.040 --> 04:04:48.309 align:start position:0%
the hash but it's kind of Brute Force I
don't<04:04:47.120><c> know</c><04:04:47.239><c> if</c><04:04:47.319><c> it's</c><04:04:47.479><c> the</c><04:04:47.600><c> best</c><04:04:47.760><c> way</c><04:04:47.840><c> to</c><04:04:47.960><c> do</c><04:04:48.080><c> it</c>

04:04:48.309 --> 04:04:48.319 align:start position:0%
don't know if it's the best way to do it
 

04:04:48.319 --> 04:04:50.030 align:start position:0%
don't know if it's the best way to do it
no<04:04:48.520><c> no</c><04:04:48.640><c> I</c><04:04:48.800><c> I</c><04:04:48.880><c> think</c><04:04:49.040><c> that</c><04:04:49.199><c> totally</c><04:04:49.560><c> works</c><04:04:49.840><c> and</c><04:04:49.960><c> I</c>

04:04:50.030 --> 04:04:50.040 align:start position:0%
no no I I think that totally works and I
 

04:04:50.040 --> 04:04:51.389 align:start position:0%
no no I I think that totally works and I
think<04:04:50.199><c> this</c><04:04:50.279><c> is</c><04:04:50.479><c> actually</c><04:04:50.720><c> a</c><04:04:50.840><c> valid</c><04:04:51.080><c> solution</c>

04:04:51.389 --> 04:04:51.399 align:start position:0%
think this is actually a valid solution
 

04:04:51.399 --> 04:04:52.670 align:start position:0%
think this is actually a valid solution
the<04:04:51.520><c> solution</c><04:04:51.840><c> makes</c><04:04:52.040><c> sense</c><04:04:52.239><c> to</c><04:04:52.399><c> people</c><04:04:52.600><c> in</c>

04:04:52.670 --> 04:04:52.680 align:start position:0%
the solution makes sense to people in
 

04:04:52.680 --> 04:04:54.870 align:start position:0%
the solution makes sense to people in
the<04:04:52.840><c> room</c><04:04:53.800><c> and</c><04:04:53.960><c> and</c><04:04:54.199><c> adjustin</c><04:04:54.680><c> can</c><04:04:54.760><c> you</c>

04:04:54.870 --> 04:04:54.880 align:start position:0%
the room and and adjustin can you
 

04:04:54.880 --> 04:04:58.110 align:start position:0%
the room and and adjustin can you
explain<04:04:55.239><c> why</c><04:04:55.359><c> it</c><04:04:55.439><c> needs</c><04:04:55.600><c> to</c><04:04:55.680><c> be</c><04:04:55.760><c> a</c><04:04:55.840><c> zkp</c><04:04:56.720><c> yeah</c><04:04:57.120><c> so</c>

04:04:58.110 --> 04:04:58.120 align:start position:0%
explain why it needs to be a zkp yeah so
 

04:04:58.120 --> 04:05:00.349 align:start position:0%
explain why it needs to be a zkp yeah so
okay<04:04:58.319><c> so</c><04:04:58.920><c> do</c><04:04:59.080><c> you</c><04:04:59.199><c> guys</c><04:04:59.319><c> know</c><04:04:59.439><c> what</c><04:04:59.560><c> a</c><04:04:59.760><c> hashes</c>

04:05:00.349 --> 04:05:00.359 align:start position:0%
okay so do you guys know what a hashes
 

04:05:00.359 --> 04:05:02.229 align:start position:0%
okay so do you guys know what a hashes
like<04:05:00.479><c> you</c><04:05:00.600><c> take</c><04:05:00.800><c> some</c><04:05:01.199><c> some</c><04:05:01.479><c> value</c><04:05:01.960><c> you</c><04:05:02.080><c> can</c>

04:05:02.229 --> 04:05:02.239 align:start position:0%
like you take some some value you can
 

04:05:02.239 --> 04:05:03.910 align:start position:0%
like you take some some value you can
turn<04:05:02.560><c> into</c><04:05:02.720><c> a</c><04:05:02.840><c> hash</c><04:05:03.159><c> but</c><04:05:03.279><c> you</c><04:05:03.399><c> can't</c><04:05:03.640><c> go</c><04:05:03.760><c> from</c>

04:05:03.910 --> 04:05:03.920 align:start position:0%
turn into a hash but you can't go from
 

04:05:03.920 --> 04:05:05.389 align:start position:0%
turn into a hash but you can't go from
the<04:05:04.040><c> hash</c><04:05:04.239><c> and</c><04:05:04.319><c> turn</c><04:05:04.479><c> it</c><04:05:04.600><c> back</c><04:05:04.760><c> into</c><04:05:04.920><c> the</c><04:05:05.040><c> value</c>

04:05:05.389 --> 04:05:05.399 align:start position:0%
the hash and turn it back into the value
 

04:05:05.399 --> 04:05:06.870 align:start position:0%
the hash and turn it back into the value
so<04:05:05.520><c> if</c><04:05:05.600><c> you</c><04:05:05.760><c> put</c><04:05:05.920><c> the</c><04:05:06.040><c> hash</c><04:05:06.279><c> of</c><04:05:06.399><c> the</c><04:05:06.560><c> password</c>

04:05:06.870 --> 04:05:06.880 align:start position:0%
so if you put the hash of the password
 

04:05:06.880 --> 04:05:08.630 align:start position:0%
so if you put the hash of the password
on<04:05:07.000><c> the</c><04:05:07.120><c> blockchain</c><04:05:07.840><c> you</c><04:05:08.040><c> commit</c><04:05:08.319><c> to</c><04:05:08.439><c> the</c>

04:05:08.630 --> 04:05:08.640 align:start position:0%
on the blockchain you commit to the
 

04:05:08.640 --> 04:05:10.149 align:start position:0%
on the blockchain you commit to the
password<04:05:09.000><c> but</c><04:05:09.159><c> people</c><04:05:09.359><c> cannot</c><04:05:09.680><c> recover</c><04:05:10.040><c> the</c>

04:05:10.149 --> 04:05:10.159 align:start position:0%

04:05:11.990 --> 04:05:12.000 align:start position:0%
password from the hash and now your
 

04:05:12.000 --> 04:05:14.189 align:start position:0%
password from the hash and now your
problem<04:05:12.279><c> is</c><04:05:12.680><c> can</c><04:05:12.840><c> someone</c><04:05:13.239><c> show</c><04:05:13.920><c> that</c><04:05:14.040><c> they</c>

04:05:14.189 --> 04:05:14.199 align:start position:0%
problem is can someone show that they
 

04:05:14.199 --> 04:05:16.269 align:start position:0%
problem is can someone show that they

04:05:16.269 --> 04:05:16.279 align:start position:0%
know the thing behind the hash without
 

04:05:16.279 --> 04:05:18.149 align:start position:0%
know the thing behind the hash without

04:05:18.149 --> 04:05:18.159 align:start position:0%
revealing to everybody else so if you
 

04:05:18.159 --> 04:05:19.830 align:start position:0%
revealing to everybody else so if you
were<04:05:18.359><c> to</c><04:05:18.600><c> just</c><04:05:18.880><c> put</c><04:05:19.080><c> the</c><04:05:19.279><c> password</c><04:05:19.600><c> in</c><04:05:19.680><c> a</c>

04:05:19.830 --> 04:05:19.840 align:start position:0%
were to just put the password in a

were to just put the password in a

04:05:29.070 --> 04:05:29.080 align:start position:0%
like see it in the menol and front run
 

04:05:29.080 --> 04:05:30.790 align:start position:0%
like see it in the menol and front run
you<04:05:29.479><c> so</c><04:05:29.720><c> what</c><04:05:29.840><c> you</c><04:05:29.920><c> do</c><04:05:30.080><c> instead</c><04:05:30.399><c> you</c><04:05:30.520><c> make</c><04:05:30.640><c> a</c>

04:05:34.389 --> 04:05:34.399 align:start position:0%
the preimage of the hash yes so that's
 

04:05:34.399 --> 04:05:35.550 align:start position:0%
the preimage of the hash yes so that's

04:10:21.429 --> 04:10:21.439 align:start position:0%
but but one thing I'm wondering if it's
 

04:10:21.439 --> 04:10:22.590 align:start position:0%
but but one thing I'm wondering if it's
useful<04:10:21.800><c> is</c>

04:10:22.590 --> 04:10:22.600 align:start position:0%
useful is
 

04:10:22.600 --> 04:10:25.309 align:start position:0%
useful is
to<04:10:23.600><c> uh</c><04:10:23.760><c> consider</c><04:10:24.080><c> the</c><04:10:24.239><c> truth</c><04:10:24.560><c> Vector</c><04:10:24.920><c> to</c><04:10:25.040><c> be</c>

04:10:25.309 --> 04:10:25.319 align:start position:0%
to uh consider the truth Vector to be
 

04:10:25.319 --> 04:10:27.830 align:start position:0%
to uh consider the truth Vector to be
zero<04:10:26.040><c> okay</c><04:10:26.600><c> so</c><04:10:26.960><c> and</c><04:10:27.040><c> then</c><04:10:27.199><c> we</c><04:10:27.399><c> shift</c>

04:10:27.830 --> 04:10:27.840 align:start position:0%
zero okay so and then we shift
 

04:10:27.840 --> 04:10:29.510 align:start position:0%
zero okay so and then we shift
everything<04:10:28.279><c> by</c><04:10:28.399><c> the</c><04:10:28.520><c> truth</c><04:10:28.840><c> ve</c><04:10:29.040><c> I</c><04:10:29.119><c> mean</c><04:10:29.399><c> okay</c>

04:10:29.510 --> 04:10:29.520 align:start position:0%
everything by the truth ve I mean okay
 

04:10:29.520 --> 04:10:31.550 align:start position:0%
everything by the truth ve I mean okay
so<04:10:29.680><c> as</c><04:10:29.960><c> reshift</c><04:10:30.479><c> everything</c><04:10:30.880><c> then</c><04:10:31.080><c> stuff</c><04:10:31.359><c> much</c>

04:10:31.550 --> 04:10:31.560 align:start position:0%
so as reshift everything then stuff much
 

04:10:31.560 --> 04:10:34.429 align:start position:0%
so as reshift everything then stuff much
simpler<04:10:32.279><c> at</c><04:10:32.359><c> least</c><04:10:32.600><c> conceptually</c><04:10:33.600><c> uh</c><04:10:34.000><c> so</c><04:10:34.319><c> this</c>

04:10:34.429 --> 04:10:34.439 align:start position:0%
simpler at least conceptually uh so this
 

04:10:34.439 --> 04:10:35.710 align:start position:0%
simpler at least conceptually uh so this
is<04:10:34.600><c> what</c><04:10:34.760><c> I</c><04:10:34.880><c> thought</c><04:10:35.080><c> too</c><04:10:35.359><c> but</c><04:10:35.479><c> but</c><04:10:35.560><c> it</c>

04:10:35.710 --> 04:10:35.720 align:start position:0%
is what I thought too but but it
 

04:10:35.720 --> 04:10:37.189 align:start position:0%
is what I thought too but but it
actually<04:10:36.000><c> doesn't</c><04:10:36.359><c> because</c><04:10:36.520><c> the</c><04:10:36.640><c> truth</c><04:10:36.960><c> truth</c>

04:10:37.189 --> 04:10:37.199 align:start position:0%
actually doesn't because the truth truth
 

04:10:37.199 --> 04:10:38.790 align:start position:0%
actually doesn't because the truth truth
Vector<04:10:37.479><c> could</c><04:10:37.600><c> end</c><04:10:37.800><c> up</c><04:10:38.000><c> anywhere</c><04:10:38.600><c> and</c>

04:10:38.790 --> 04:10:38.800 align:start position:0%
Vector could end up anywhere and
 

04:10:38.800 --> 04:10:41.550 align:start position:0%
Vector could end up anywhere and
distance<04:10:39.159><c> from</c><04:10:39.439><c> zero</c><04:10:39.880><c> is</c><04:10:40.080><c> the</c><04:10:40.279><c> vector</c><04:10:40.680><c> itself</c>

04:10:41.550 --> 04:10:41.560 align:start position:0%
distance from zero is the vector itself
 

04:10:41.560 --> 04:10:43.469 align:start position:0%
distance from zero is the vector itself
so<04:10:41.680><c> it</c><04:10:41.840><c> kind</c><04:10:41.960><c> of</c><04:10:42.119><c> keeps</c><04:10:42.399><c> everything</c><04:10:42.800><c> exactly</c>

04:10:43.469 --> 04:10:43.479 align:start position:0%
so it kind of keeps everything exactly
 

04:10:43.479 --> 04:10:44.670 align:start position:0%
so it kind of keeps everything exactly
the<04:10:43.560><c> same</c><04:10:43.800><c> in</c><04:10:43.920><c> your</c>

it<04:10:54.840><c> give</c><04:10:54.960><c> us</c><04:10:55.080><c> a</c><04:10:55.319><c> hint</c><04:10:56.319><c> um</c><04:10:56.720><c> the</c><04:10:56.920><c> the</c><04:10:57.119><c> hint</c><04:10:57.439><c> is</c><04:10:57.680><c> you</c>

04:10:57.830 --> 04:10:57.840 align:start position:0%
it give us a hint um the the hint is you
 

04:10:57.840 --> 04:11:00.189 align:start position:0%
it give us a hint um the the hint is you
have<04:10:57.960><c> to</c><04:10:58.119><c> stare</c><04:10:58.720><c> well</c><04:10:58.920><c> so</c><04:10:59.479><c> do</c><04:10:59.600><c> we</c><04:11:00.000><c> understand</c>

04:11:00.189 --> 04:11:00.199 align:start position:0%
have to stare well so do we understand
 

04:11:00.199 --> 04:11:02.309 align:start position:0%
have to stare well so do we understand
like<04:11:00.359><c> the</c><04:11:00.479><c> coree</c><04:11:01.239><c> problem</c><04:11:01.560><c> with</c><04:11:01.720><c> this</c><04:11:01.960><c> like</c><04:11:02.239><c> I</c>

04:11:02.309 --> 04:11:02.319 align:start position:0%
like the coree problem with this like I
 

04:11:02.319 --> 04:11:03.910 align:start position:0%
like the coree problem with this like I
guess<04:11:02.439><c> a</c><04:11:02.680><c> question</c><04:11:03.000><c> somebody</c><04:11:03.319><c> should</c><04:11:03.560><c> ask</c><04:11:03.800><c> is</c>

04:11:03.910 --> 04:11:03.920 align:start position:0%
guess a question somebody should ask is
 

04:11:03.920 --> 04:11:05.870 align:start position:0%
guess a question somebody should ask is
like<04:11:04.199><c> why</c><04:11:04.319><c> don't</c><04:11:04.439><c> we</c><04:11:04.560><c> just</c><04:11:04.760><c> sum</c><04:11:05.159><c> the</c><04:11:05.359><c> distances</c>

04:11:05.870 --> 04:11:05.880 align:start position:0%
like why don't we just sum the distances
 

04:11:05.880 --> 04:11:07.269 align:start position:0%
like why don't we just sum the distances
at<04:11:06.040><c> the</c><04:11:06.119><c> end</c><04:11:06.520><c> yeah</c><04:11:06.640><c> are</c><04:11:06.720><c> you</c><04:11:06.840><c> assuming</c><04:11:07.159><c> that</c>

04:11:07.269 --> 04:11:07.279 align:start position:0%
at the end yeah are you assuming that
 

04:11:07.279 --> 04:11:09.389 align:start position:0%
at the end yeah are you assuming that
you<04:11:07.399><c> don't</c><04:11:07.479><c> want</c><04:11:07.560><c> to</c><04:11:07.640><c> have</c><04:11:07.760><c> an</c><04:11:07.880><c> O</c><04:11:08.080><c> of</c><04:11:08.239><c> n</c><04:11:08.840><c> exactly</c>

04:11:09.389 --> 04:11:09.399 align:start position:0%
you don't want to have an O of n exactly
 

04:11:09.399 --> 04:11:10.870 align:start position:0%
you don't want to have an O of n exactly
because<04:11:09.600><c> we're</c><04:11:09.800><c> on</c><04:11:09.960><c> a</c><04:11:10.159><c> block</c><04:11:10.520><c> I</c><04:11:10.640><c> kind</c><04:11:10.760><c> of</c>

04:11:10.870 --> 04:11:10.880 align:start position:0%
because we're on a block I kind of
 

04:11:10.880 --> 04:11:12.109 align:start position:0%
because we're on a block I kind of
expected<04:11:11.199><c> somebody</c><04:11:11.439><c> to</c><04:11:11.600><c> say</c><04:11:11.720><c> it</c><04:11:11.840><c> and</c><04:11:11.960><c> then</c><04:11:12.040><c> I</c>

04:11:12.109 --> 04:11:12.119 align:start position:0%
expected somebody to say it and then I
 

04:11:12.119 --> 04:11:14.070 align:start position:0%
expected somebody to say it and then I
would<04:11:12.279><c> be</c><04:11:12.399><c> like</c><04:11:12.600><c> no</c><04:11:12.960><c> but</c><04:11:13.439><c> why</c><04:11:13.600><c> we</c><04:11:13.720><c> can't</c><04:11:13.920><c> just</c>

04:11:14.070 --> 04:11:14.080 align:start position:0%
would be like no but why we can't just
 

04:11:14.080 --> 04:11:16.189 align:start position:0%
would be like no but why we can't just
sum<04:11:14.479><c> the</c><04:11:14.640><c> distances</c><04:11:15.159><c> at</c><04:11:15.279><c> the</c><04:11:15.359><c> end</c><04:11:15.600><c> is</c><04:11:15.800><c> because</c>

04:11:16.189 --> 04:11:16.199 align:start position:0%
sum the distances at the end is because
 

04:11:16.199 --> 04:11:17.790 align:start position:0%
sum the distances at the end is because
there<04:11:16.359><c> might</c><04:11:16.520><c> be</c><04:11:16.680><c> end</c><04:11:17.000><c> players</c><04:11:17.439><c> and</c><04:11:17.600><c> then</c><04:11:17.680><c> we</c>

04:11:17.790 --> 04:11:17.800 align:start position:0%
there might be end players and then we
 

04:11:17.800 --> 04:11:19.590 align:start position:0%
there might be end players and then we
need<04:11:17.920><c> to</c><04:11:18.080><c> do</c><04:11:18.399><c> like</c><04:11:18.680><c> you</c><04:11:18.800><c> know</c><04:11:18.960><c> on</c><04:11:19.080><c> the</c><04:11:19.199><c> order</c><04:11:19.479><c> of</c>

04:11:19.590 --> 04:11:19.600 align:start position:0%
need to do like you know on the order of
 

04:11:19.600 --> 04:11:21.670 align:start position:0%
need to do like you know on the order of
end<04:11:19.880><c> computations</c><04:11:20.520><c> it</c><04:11:20.680><c> might</c><04:11:20.840><c> brick</c><04:11:21.159><c> the</c><04:11:21.399><c> game</c>

04:11:21.670 --> 04:11:21.680 align:start position:0%
end computations it might brick the game
 

04:11:21.680 --> 04:11:25.149 align:start position:0%
end computations it might brick the game

problem all right I'll give it to you um
can<04:11:32.119><c> it</c><04:11:32.199><c> be</c><04:11:32.319><c> an</c><04:11:32.600><c> incremental</c><04:11:33.600><c> what</c><04:11:33.720><c> does</c><04:11:33.840><c> that</c>

04:11:33.950 --> 04:11:33.960 align:start position:0%
can it be an incremental what does that
 

04:11:33.960 --> 04:11:35.149 align:start position:0%
can it be an incremental what does that

04:11:35.149 --> 04:11:35.159 align:start position:0%
mean well every time someone adds a

vector they do an incremental amount of
 

04:11:36.560 --> 04:11:39.149 align:start position:0%
vector they do an incremental amount of

04:11:39.149 --> 04:11:39.159 align:start position:0%
competition okay so it would it would
 

04:11:39.159 --> 04:11:40.550 align:start position:0%

04:11:44.429 --> 04:11:44.439 align:start position:0%
it in one go at the end exactly great
 

04:11:44.439 --> 04:11:46.269 align:start position:0%

wonder<04:12:02.359><c> if</c><04:12:02.560><c> this</c><04:12:02.800><c> expression</c><04:12:03.279><c> can</c><04:12:03.439><c> be</c>

04:12:03.750 --> 04:12:03.760 align:start position:0%
wonder if this expression can be
 

04:12:03.760 --> 04:12:06.389 align:start position:0%
wonder if this expression can be
factorized<04:12:04.760><c> yeah</c><04:12:04.920><c> how</c><04:12:05.000><c> would</c><04:12:05.119><c> you</c><04:12:05.239><c> factor</c><04:12:05.520><c> it</c>

04:12:06.389 --> 04:12:06.399 align:start position:0%
factorized yeah how would you factor it
 

04:12:06.399 --> 04:12:08.189 align:start position:0%
factorized yeah how would you factor it
uh<04:12:06.640><c> I</c><04:12:06.760><c> see</c><04:12:07.000><c> there</c><04:12:07.279><c> there</c><04:12:07.359><c> is</c><04:12:07.439><c> the</c><04:12:07.560><c> dot</c><04:12:07.800><c> product</c>

04:12:08.189 --> 04:12:08.199 align:start position:0%
uh I see there there is the dot product
 

04:12:08.199 --> 04:12:09.630 align:start position:0%
uh I see there there is the dot product
I'm<04:12:08.359><c> I'm</c><04:12:08.479><c> not</c><04:12:08.640><c> sure</c><04:12:08.840><c> about</c><04:12:09.159><c> if</c><04:12:09.279><c> the</c><04:12:09.439><c> dot</c>

04:12:09.630 --> 04:12:09.640 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm not sure about if the dot
 

04:12:09.640 --> 04:12:11.309 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm not sure about if the dot
product<04:12:09.960><c> can</c><04:12:10.080><c> be</c><04:12:10.279><c> factorized</c><04:12:10.800><c> but</c><04:12:11.000><c> I</c><04:12:11.080><c> think</c>

04:12:11.309 --> 04:12:11.319 align:start position:0%
product can be factorized but I think

distances<04:13:28.319><c> weren't</c><04:13:28.800><c> like</c><04:13:29.119><c> crazy</c><04:13:29.600><c> enough</c><04:13:30.040><c> and</c>

04:13:30.109 --> 04:13:30.119 align:start position:0%
distances weren't like crazy enough and
 

04:13:30.119 --> 04:13:32.189 align:start position:0%
distances weren't like crazy enough and
so<04:13:30.279><c> the</c><04:13:30.439><c> market</c><04:13:30.760><c> was</c><04:13:30.960><c> like</c><04:13:31.159><c> kind</c><04:13:31.319><c> of</c><04:13:31.520><c> boring</c>

04:13:32.189 --> 04:13:32.199 align:start position:0%
so the market was like kind of boring
 

04:13:32.199 --> 04:13:34.309 align:start position:0%
so the market was like kind of boring
and<04:13:32.359><c> like</c><04:13:32.680><c> fundamentally</c><04:13:33.520><c> now</c><04:13:33.840><c> like</c><04:13:34.159><c> this</c>

04:13:34.309 --> 04:13:34.319 align:start position:0%
and like fundamentally now like this
 

04:13:34.319 --> 04:13:36.910 align:start position:0%
and like fundamentally now like this
kind<04:13:34.479><c> of</c><04:13:34.680><c> sucks</c><04:13:35.159><c> because</c><04:13:36.000><c> you</c><04:13:36.159><c> can</c><04:13:36.520><c> expand</c>

04:13:36.910 --> 04:13:36.920 align:start position:0%
kind of sucks because you can expand
 

04:13:36.920 --> 04:13:38.950 align:start position:0%
kind of sucks because you can expand
this<04:13:37.159><c> out</c><04:13:37.479><c> actually</c><04:13:37.680><c> can</c><04:13:37.840><c> use</c><04:13:38.000><c> ukian</c><04:13:38.600><c> distance</c>

04:13:38.950 --> 04:13:38.960 align:start position:0%
this out actually can use ukian distance
 

04:13:38.960 --> 04:13:40.109 align:start position:0%
this out actually can use ukian distance
here<04:13:39.080><c> and</c><04:13:39.199><c> then</c><04:13:39.319><c> because</c><04:13:39.520><c> there's</c><04:13:39.640><c> a</c><04:13:39.760><c> squared</c>

04:13:40.109 --> 04:13:40.119 align:start position:0%
here and then because there's a squared
 

04:13:40.119 --> 04:13:42.030 align:start position:0%
here and then because there's a squared
and<04:13:40.239><c> a</c><04:13:40.359><c> square</c><04:13:40.640><c> root</c><04:13:41.199><c> it</c><04:13:41.359><c> like</c><04:13:41.560><c> you</c><04:13:41.680><c> know</c><04:13:41.880><c> ends</c>

04:13:42.030 --> 04:13:42.040 align:start position:0%
and a square root it like you know ends
 

04:13:42.040 --> 04:13:43.710 align:start position:0%
and a square root it like you know ends
up<04:13:42.199><c> being</c><04:13:42.399><c> kind</c><04:13:42.560><c> of</c><04:13:42.680><c> nice</c><04:13:43.119><c> you</c><04:13:43.199><c> still</c><04:13:43.399><c> can't</c><04:13:43.600><c> do</c>

04:13:43.710 --> 04:13:43.720 align:start position:0%
up being kind of nice you still can't do
 

04:13:43.720 --> 04:13:45.950 align:start position:0%
up being kind of nice you still can't do
it<04:13:44.319><c> um</c><04:13:44.720><c> because</c><04:13:45.000><c> high</c><04:13:45.199><c> level</c><04:13:45.479><c> what</c><04:13:45.560><c> you</c><04:13:45.680><c> did</c><04:13:45.840><c> is</c>

04:13:45.950 --> 04:13:45.960 align:start position:0%
it um because high level what you did is
 

04:13:45.960 --> 04:13:48.550 align:start position:0%
it um because high level what you did is
you<04:13:46.119><c> like</c><04:13:46.359><c> added</c><04:13:46.800><c> non</c><04:13:47.080><c> nonlinearities</c><04:13:47.880><c> to</c><04:13:48.399><c> a</c>

04:13:48.550 --> 04:13:48.560 align:start position:0%
you like added non nonlinearities to a
 

04:13:48.560 --> 04:13:50.990 align:start position:0%
you like added non nonlinearities to a
thing<04:13:48.800><c> which</c><04:13:48.960><c> we</c><04:13:49.040><c> were</c><04:13:49.319><c> like</c><04:13:50.080><c> was</c><04:13:50.359><c> really</c><04:13:50.680><c> nice</c>

04:13:50.990 --> 04:13:51.000 align:start position:0%
thing which we were like was really nice
 

04:13:51.000 --> 04:13:53.229 align:start position:0%
thing which we were like was really nice
that<04:13:51.159><c> it</c><04:13:51.279><c> happened</c><04:13:51.560><c> to</c><04:13:51.640><c> be</c><04:13:51.760><c> linear</c><04:13:52.680><c> um</c><04:13:53.000><c> and</c><04:13:53.080><c> so</c>

04:13:53.229 --> 04:13:53.239 align:start position:0%
that it happened to be linear um and so
 

04:13:53.239 --> 04:13:55.070 align:start position:0%
that it happened to be linear um and so
to<04:13:53.359><c> do</c><04:13:53.680><c> this</c><04:13:54.000><c> there's</c><04:13:54.279><c> two</c><04:13:54.560><c> things</c><04:13:54.800><c> that</c><04:13:54.960><c> we</c>

04:13:55.070 --> 04:13:55.080 align:start position:0%
to do this there's two things that we
 

04:13:55.080 --> 04:13:57.670 align:start position:0%
to do this there's two things that we
aligned<04:13:55.439><c> on</c><04:13:56.000><c> one</c><04:13:56.279><c> was</c><04:13:56.560><c> you</c><04:13:56.680><c> could</c><04:13:56.800><c> do</c><04:13:56.920><c> a</c><04:13:57.040><c> zkp</c>

04:13:57.670 --> 04:13:57.680 align:start position:0%
aligned on one was you could do a zkp
 

04:13:57.680 --> 04:13:59.950 align:start position:0%
aligned on one was you could do a zkp
using<04:13:58.000><c> something</c><04:13:58.279><c> like</c><04:13:58.439><c> sp1</c><04:13:59.279><c> right</c><04:13:59.439><c> to</c><04:13:59.640><c> like</c>

04:13:59.950 --> 04:13:59.960 align:start position:0%
using something like sp1 right to like
 

04:13:59.960 --> 04:14:02.149 align:start position:0%
using something like sp1 right to like
succinctly<04:14:00.640><c> verify</c><04:14:01.040><c> the</c><04:14:01.159><c> sum</c><04:14:01.439><c> on</c><04:14:01.640><c> chain</c><04:14:01.880><c> later</c>

04:14:02.149 --> 04:14:02.159 align:start position:0%
succinctly verify the sum on chain later
 

04:14:02.159 --> 04:14:04.510 align:start position:0%
succinctly verify the sum on chain later
and<04:14:02.319><c> comput</c><04:14:02.560><c> it</c><04:14:02.720><c> offchain</c><04:14:03.720><c> um</c><04:14:03.960><c> but</c><04:14:04.080><c> it</c><04:14:04.199><c> turns</c>

04:14:04.510 --> 04:14:04.520 align:start position:0%
and comput it offchain um but it turns
 

04:14:04.520 --> 04:14:06.790 align:start position:0%
and comput it offchain um but it turns
out<04:14:04.840><c> that</c><04:14:05.000><c> like</c><04:14:05.319><c> the</c><04:14:05.640><c> cost</c><04:14:06.000><c> of</c><04:14:06.159><c> doing</c><04:14:06.520><c> that</c><04:14:06.680><c> on</c>

04:14:06.790 --> 04:14:06.800 align:start position:0%
out that like the cost of doing that on
 

04:14:06.800 --> 04:14:09.309 align:start position:0%
out that like the cost of doing that on
their<04:14:07.080><c> approver</c><04:14:07.439><c> network</c><04:14:08.040><c> is</c><04:14:08.319><c> actually</c><04:14:08.760><c> more</c>

04:14:09.309 --> 04:14:09.319 align:start position:0%
their approver network is actually more
 

04:14:09.319 --> 04:14:11.109 align:start position:0%
their approver network is actually more

04:14:11.109 --> 04:14:11.119 align:start position:0%
than the cost of literally just looping
 

04:14:11.119 --> 04:14:13.590 align:start position:0%
than the cost of literally just looping

04:14:13.590 --> 04:14:13.600 align:start position:0%
on chain and doing the sum because the
 

04:14:13.600 --> 04:14:15.630 align:start position:0%
on chain and doing the sum because the
vectors<04:14:14.000><c> were</c><04:14:14.199><c> of</c><04:14:14.359><c> such</c><04:14:14.600><c> high</c><04:14:14.800><c> dimension</c><04:14:15.560><c> and</c>

04:14:15.630 --> 04:14:15.640 align:start position:0%
vectors were of such high dimension and
 

04:14:15.640 --> 04:14:17.510 align:start position:0%
vectors were of such high dimension and
so<04:14:15.760><c> we</c><04:14:15.960><c> actually</c><04:14:16.239><c> did</c><04:14:16.479><c> end</c><04:14:16.680><c> up</c><04:14:16.840><c> doing</c><04:14:17.319><c> the</c>

04:14:17.510 --> 04:14:17.520 align:start position:0%
so we actually did end up doing the
 

04:14:17.520 --> 04:14:20.750 align:start position:0%
so we actually did end up doing the

the game diminishes and so the price
goes<04:18:13.479><c> down</c><04:18:14.439><c> so</c><04:18:15.199><c> then</c><04:18:15.319><c> you</c><04:18:15.479><c> might</c><04:18:15.640><c> not</c><04:18:15.800><c> even</c>

in that idea and I might have

04:19:16.630 --> 04:19:16.640 align:start position:0%
one's the answer I think it's a answer
 

04:19:16.640 --> 04:19:18.590 align:start position:0%
one's the answer I think it's a answer
what<04:19:16.760><c> I</c><04:19:16.880><c> ended</c><04:19:17.119><c> up</c><04:19:17.239><c> doing</c><04:19:17.479><c> is</c><04:19:17.680><c> like</c><04:19:18.199><c> drawing</c>

04:19:18.590 --> 04:19:18.600 align:start position:0%
what I ended up doing is like drawing
 

04:19:18.600 --> 04:19:21.229 align:start position:0%
what I ended up doing is like drawing
this<04:19:18.720><c> little</c><04:19:19.000><c> curve</c><04:19:19.560><c> in</c><04:19:19.720><c> Desmos</c><04:19:20.600><c> and</c><04:19:20.840><c> how</c><04:19:21.040><c> this</c>

04:19:21.229 --> 04:19:21.239 align:start position:0%
this little curve in Desmos and how this
 

04:19:21.239 --> 04:19:22.870 align:start position:0%
this little curve in Desmos and how this
curve<04:19:21.560><c> works</c><04:19:21.920><c> I'll</c><04:19:22.080><c> go</c><04:19:22.279><c> point</c><04:19:22.479><c> at</c><04:19:22.600><c> the</c><04:19:22.680><c> screen</c>

04:19:22.870 --> 04:19:22.880 align:start position:0%
curve works I'll go point at the screen
 

04:19:22.880 --> 04:19:24.910 align:start position:0%
curve works I'll go point at the screen
at<04:19:23.119><c> this</c><04:19:23.279><c> side</c><04:19:23.560><c> this</c><04:19:23.760><c> time</c><04:19:24.199><c> how</c><04:19:24.399><c> this</c><04:19:24.560><c> little</c>

04:19:24.910 --> 04:19:24.920 align:start position:0%
at this side this time how this little
 

04:19:24.920 --> 04:19:29.349 align:start position:0%
at this side this time how this little
curve<04:19:25.319><c> works</c><04:19:26.000><c> is</c><04:19:26.239><c> like</c><04:19:26.800><c> this</c><04:19:26.920><c> is</c><04:19:27.760><c> time</c><04:19:28.760><c> this</c><04:19:28.920><c> is</c>

04:19:29.349 --> 04:19:29.359 align:start position:0%
curve works is like this is time this is
 

04:19:29.359 --> 04:19:32.830 align:start position:0%
curve works is like this is time this is
the<04:19:29.960><c> price</c><04:19:30.960><c> and</c><04:19:31.119><c> whatever</c><04:19:31.479><c> you</c><04:19:31.760><c> buy</c><04:19:32.479><c> it</c><04:19:32.640><c> just</c>

04:19:32.830 --> 04:19:32.840 align:start position:0%
the price and whatever you buy it just
 

04:19:32.840 --> 04:19:38.630 align:start position:0%
the price and whatever you buy it just
like<04:19:33.159><c> jumps</c><04:19:33.800><c> a</c><04:19:34.040><c> fixed</c><04:19:34.520><c> amount</c><04:19:35.399><c> of</c><04:19:35.760><c> X</c><04:19:36.520><c> on</c><04:19:36.920><c> this</c>

04:19:38.630 --> 04:19:38.640 align:start position:0%
like jumps a fixed amount of X on this
 

04:19:38.640 --> 04:19:41.670 align:start position:0%
like jumps a fixed amount of X on this
curve<04:19:39.640><c> does</c><04:19:39.800><c> that</c><04:19:39.920><c> make</c><04:19:40.119><c> sense</c><04:19:41.040><c> and</c><04:19:41.159><c> so</c><04:19:41.520><c> why</c>

04:19:41.670 --> 04:19:41.680 align:start position:0%
curve does that make sense and so why
 

04:19:41.680 --> 04:19:44.990 align:start position:0%
curve does that make sense and so why
this<04:19:41.800><c> is</c><04:19:42.000><c> really</c><04:19:42.239><c> really</c><04:19:42.960><c> is</c><04:19:43.159><c> like</c><04:19:44.159><c> and</c><04:19:44.640><c> up</c>

04:19:44.990 --> 04:19:45.000 align:start position:0%
this is really really is like and up
 

04:19:45.000 --> 04:19:48.070 align:start position:0%
this is really really is like and up
here<04:19:45.760><c> right</c><04:19:46.000><c> like</c><04:19:46.159><c> around</c><04:19:46.479><c> $300</c><04:19:47.479><c> this</c><04:19:47.640><c> line</c><04:19:47.880><c> is</c>

04:19:48.070 --> 04:19:48.080 align:start position:0%
here right like around $300 this line is
 

04:19:48.080 --> 04:19:50.229 align:start position:0%
here right like around $300 this line is
straight<04:19:48.520><c> up</c><04:19:49.080><c> and</c><04:19:49.159><c> so</c><04:19:49.279><c> if</c><04:19:49.439><c> like</c><04:19:49.600><c> somebody</c><04:19:49.960><c> buys</c>

04:19:50.229 --> 04:19:50.239 align:start position:0%
straight up and so if like somebody buys
 

04:19:50.239 --> 04:19:52.790 align:start position:0%
straight up and so if like somebody buys
at<04:19:50.359><c> $300</c><04:19:51.359><c> the</c><04:19:51.479><c> price</c><04:19:51.680><c> is</c><04:19:51.800><c> going</c><04:19:51.920><c> to</c><04:19:52.040><c> like</c><04:19:52.279><c> sky</c>

04:19:52.790 --> 04:19:52.800 align:start position:0%
at $300 the price is going to like sky
 

04:19:52.800 --> 04:19:56.030 align:start position:0%
at $300 the price is going to like sky
like<04:19:53.119><c> crazy</c><04:19:53.680><c> and</c><04:19:53.760><c> then</c><04:19:53.920><c> Fall</c><04:19:54.319><c> Down</c><04:19:54.800><c> super</c><04:19:55.319><c> fast</c>

04:19:56.030 --> 04:19:56.040 align:start position:0%
like crazy and then Fall Down super fast
 

04:19:56.040 --> 04:19:57.670 align:start position:0%
like crazy and then Fall Down super fast
and<04:19:56.119><c> then</c><04:19:56.279><c> like</c><04:19:56.479><c> around</c><04:19:56.920><c> here</c><04:19:57.199><c> like</c><04:19:57.319><c> the</c><04:19:57.439><c> price</c>

04:19:57.670 --> 04:19:57.680 align:start position:0%
and then like around here like the price
 

04:19:57.680 --> 04:20:00.070 align:start position:0%
and then like around here like the price
is<04:19:58.159><c> kind</c><04:19:58.359><c> of</c><04:19:58.680><c> never</c><04:19:58.960><c> going</c><04:19:59.080><c> to</c><04:19:59.239><c> get</c><04:19:59.439><c> lower</c><04:19:59.880><c> than</c>

04:20:00.070 --> 04:20:00.080 align:start position:0%
is kind of never going to get lower than
 

04:20:00.080 --> 04:20:02.389 align:start position:0%
is kind of never going to get lower than
some<04:20:00.279><c> amount</c><04:20:00.479><c> of</c><04:20:00.680><c> T</c><04:20:01.119><c> than</c><04:20:01.319><c> like</c><04:20:01.960><c> what</c><04:20:02.080><c> whatever</c>

04:20:02.389 --> 04:20:02.399 align:start position:0%
some amount of T than like what whatever
 

04:20:02.399 --> 04:20:04.630 align:start position:0%
some amount of T than like what whatever
this<04:20:02.560><c> is</c><04:20:02.760><c> I</c><04:20:02.840><c> think</c><04:20:03.000><c> like</c><04:20:03.159><c> around</c><04:20:03.399><c> $10</c><04:20:04.399><c> like</c>

04:20:04.630 --> 04:20:04.640 align:start position:0%
this is I think like around $10 like
 

04:20:04.640 --> 04:20:06.830 align:start position:0%
this is I think like around $10 like
kind<04:20:04.800><c> of</c><04:20:05.040><c> no</c><04:20:05.279><c> matter</c><04:20:05.680><c> interesting</c><04:20:06.199><c> gamep</c><04:20:06.520><c> play</c>

04:20:06.830 --> 04:20:06.840 align:start position:0%
kind of no matter interesting gamep play
 

04:20:06.840 --> 04:20:09.710 align:start position:0%
kind of no matter interesting gamep play
in<04:20:07.080><c> this</c><04:20:07.319><c> area</c><04:20:08.239><c> um</c><04:20:08.520><c> if</c><04:20:08.760><c> if</c><04:20:08.880><c> the</c><04:20:09.239><c> price</c><04:20:09.439><c> starts</c>

04:20:09.710 --> 04:20:09.720 align:start position:0%
in this area um if if the price starts
 

04:20:09.720 --> 04:20:11.830 align:start position:0%
in this area um if if the price starts
getting<04:20:10.000><c> pushed</c><04:20:10.319><c> up</c><04:20:10.560><c> like</c><04:20:10.840><c> crazy</c><04:20:11.560><c> because</c><04:20:11.720><c> a</c>

04:20:11.830 --> 04:20:11.840 align:start position:0%
getting pushed up like crazy because a
 

04:20:11.840 --> 04:20:14.030 align:start position:0%
getting pushed up like crazy because a
ton<04:20:11.960><c> of</c><04:20:12.080><c> people</c><04:20:12.239><c> are</c><04:20:12.399><c> playing</c><04:20:13.040><c> it</c><04:20:13.159><c> like</c><04:20:13.359><c> Falls</c>

it<04:20:40.319><c> had</c><04:20:40.520><c> been</c><04:20:41.080><c> okay</c><04:20:41.239><c> it</c><04:20:41.319><c> makes</c><04:20:41.520><c> sense</c><04:20:41.960><c> yeah</c><04:20:42.479><c> uh</c>

04:20:43.389 --> 04:20:43.399 align:start position:0%
it had been okay it makes sense yeah uh
 

04:20:43.399 --> 04:20:45.349 align:start position:0%
it had been okay it makes sense yeah uh
and<04:20:43.479><c> it</c><04:20:43.600><c> move</c><04:20:44.199><c> it</c><04:20:44.279><c> moves</c><04:20:44.520><c> forward</c><04:20:45.040><c> that's</c>

04:20:45.349 --> 04:20:45.359 align:start position:0%
and it move it moves forward that's
 

04:20:45.359 --> 04:20:47.349 align:start position:0%
and it move it moves forward that's
linear<04:20:45.800><c> and</c><04:20:45.920><c> the</c><04:20:46.119><c> curve</c><04:20:46.359><c> is</c><04:20:46.600><c> exponential</c><04:20:47.239><c> and</c>

04:20:47.349 --> 04:20:47.359 align:start position:0%
linear and the curve is exponential and
 

04:20:47.359 --> 04:20:50.910 align:start position:0%
linear and the curve is exponential and
so<04:20:47.560><c> you</c><04:20:47.720><c> you</c><04:20:47.840><c> get</c><04:20:48.000><c> your</c><04:20:48.520><c> difference</c><04:20:49.680><c> um</c><04:20:50.680><c> yeah</c>

04:20:50.910 --> 04:20:50.920 align:start position:0%
so you you get your difference um yeah
 

04:20:50.920 --> 04:20:51.670 align:start position:0%
so you you get your difference um yeah
good

04:20:51.670 --> 04:20:51.680 align:start position:0%
good
 

04:20:51.680 --> 04:20:54.710 align:start position:0%
good
catch<04:20:52.680><c> right</c><04:20:53.319><c> but</c><04:20:53.520><c> that's</c><04:20:53.720><c> how</c><04:20:53.920><c> this</c><04:20:54.119><c> works</c>

04:20:54.710 --> 04:20:54.720 align:start position:0%
catch right but that's how this works
 

04:20:54.720 --> 04:20:56.550 align:start position:0%
catch right but that's how this works
and<04:20:54.920><c> that's</c><04:20:55.080><c> what</c><04:20:55.239><c> ended</c><04:20:55.479><c> up</c><04:20:55.600><c> being</c><04:20:55.840><c> deployed</c>

04:20:56.550 --> 04:20:56.560 align:start position:0%
and that's what ended up being deployed
 

04:20:56.560 --> 04:20:58.229 align:start position:0%
and that's what ended up being deployed
one<04:20:56.760><c> really</c><04:20:57.159><c> bad</c><04:20:57.439><c> thing</c><04:20:57.680><c> well</c><04:20:57.800><c> I</c><04:20:57.880><c> don't</c><04:20:58.080><c> think</c>

04:20:58.229 --> 04:20:58.239 align:start position:0%
one really bad thing well I don't think
 

04:20:58.239 --> 04:21:00.790 align:start position:0%
one really bad thing well I don't think
it's<04:20:58.439><c> bad</c><04:20:58.840><c> but</c><04:20:59.000><c> like</c><04:20:59.359><c> one</c><04:20:59.760><c> criticism</c><04:21:00.439><c> of</c><04:21:00.600><c> this</c>

04:21:00.790 --> 04:21:00.800 align:start position:0%
it's bad but like one criticism of this
 

04:21:00.800 --> 04:21:03.149 align:start position:0%
it's bad but like one criticism of this
curve<04:21:01.359><c> was</c><04:21:01.520><c> that</c><04:21:01.720><c> like</c><04:21:02.000><c> you</c><04:21:02.199><c> can't</c><04:21:02.560><c> really</c><04:21:02.880><c> get</c>

04:21:03.149 --> 04:21:03.159 align:start position:0%
curve was that like you can't really get
 

04:21:03.159 --> 04:21:06.590 align:start position:0%
curve was that like you can't really get
letters<04:21:03.720><c> above</c><04:21:04.080><c> like</c><04:21:04.279><c> $500</c><04:21:04.920><c> or</c><04:21:05.279><c> $600</c><04:21:06.279><c> cuz</c><04:21:06.439><c> like</c>

04:21:06.590 --> 04:21:06.600 align:start position:0%
letters above like $500 or $600 cuz like
 

04:21:06.600 --> 04:21:08.670 align:start position:0%
letters above like $500 or $600 cuz like
you<04:21:06.880><c> literally</c><04:21:07.279><c> you</c><04:21:07.439><c> can't</c><04:21:07.680><c> buy</c><04:21:08.000><c> that</c><04:21:08.239><c> fast</c>

04:21:08.670 --> 04:21:08.680 align:start position:0%
you literally you can't buy that fast
 

04:21:08.680 --> 04:21:09.990 align:start position:0%
you literally you can't buy that fast
and<04:21:08.760><c> so</c><04:21:08.880><c> it</c><04:21:09.000><c> kind</c><04:21:09.119><c> of</c><04:21:09.239><c> puts</c><04:21:09.439><c> like</c><04:21:09.520><c> an</c><04:21:09.680><c> upper</c>

04:21:09.990 --> 04:21:10.000 align:start position:0%
and so it kind of puts like an upper
 

04:21:10.000 --> 04:21:11.830 align:start position:0%
and so it kind of puts like an upper
bound<04:21:10.399><c> on</c><04:21:10.520><c> the</c><04:21:10.760><c> price</c><04:21:11.040><c> of</c><04:21:11.199><c> like</c><04:21:11.399><c> how</c><04:21:11.600><c> high</c>

04:21:11.830 --> 04:21:11.840 align:start position:0%
bound on the price of like how high
 

04:21:11.840 --> 04:21:14.309 align:start position:0%
bound on the price of like how high
things<04:21:12.080><c> can</c><04:21:12.279><c> go</c><04:21:13.040><c> um</c><04:21:13.600><c> again</c><04:21:13.880><c> which</c><04:21:14.040><c> I</c><04:21:14.159><c> thought</c>

04:21:14.309 --> 04:21:14.319 align:start position:0%
things can go um again which I thought
 

04:21:14.319 --> 04:21:15.950 align:start position:0%
things can go um again which I thought
was<04:21:14.520><c> reasonable</c><04:21:15.040><c> but</c><04:21:15.199><c> but</c><04:21:15.359><c> some</c><04:21:15.520><c> people</c><04:21:15.800><c> did</c>

04:21:15.950 --> 04:21:15.960 align:start position:0%
was reasonable but but some people did
 

04:21:15.960 --> 04:21:18.229 align:start position:0%
was reasonable but but some people did
not<04:21:16.159><c> react</c><04:21:16.560><c> well</c><04:21:16.760><c> to</c>

04:21:18.229 --> 04:21:18.239 align:start position:0%

04:22:00.800 --> 04:22:02.469 align:start position:0%
yeah I'd say like the other two it's
like<04:22:01.080><c> really</c><04:22:01.399><c> not</c>

04:22:02.469 --> 04:22:02.479 align:start position:0%
like really not
 

04:22:02.479 --> 04:22:05.309 align:start position:0%
like really not
important<04:22:03.479><c> better</c><04:22:04.359><c> oh</c><04:22:04.560><c> oh</c><04:22:04.720><c> the</c><04:22:04.880><c> question</c><04:22:05.119><c> was</c>

04:22:05.309 --> 04:22:05.319 align:start position:0%
important better oh oh the question was
 

04:22:05.319 --> 04:22:06.990 align:start position:0%
important better oh oh the question was
how<04:22:05.520><c> important</c><04:22:05.880><c> is</c><04:22:05.960><c> it</c><04:22:06.080><c> for</c><04:22:06.239><c> players</c><04:22:06.560><c> to</c><04:22:06.760><c> ask</c>

04:22:06.990 --> 04:22:07.000 align:start position:0%
how important is it for players to ask
 

04:22:07.000 --> 04:22:09.670 align:start position:0%
how important is it for players to ask
these<04:22:07.159><c> formulas</c><04:22:07.880><c> to</c><04:22:08.520><c> formulas</c><04:22:09.439><c> um</c>

04:22:09.670 --> 04:22:09.680 align:start position:0%
these formulas to formulas um
 

04:22:09.680 --> 04:22:13.070 align:start position:0%
these formulas to formulas um
specifically<04:22:10.159><c> the</c><04:22:10.319><c> last</c><04:22:10.520><c> one</c><04:22:11.399><c> uh</c><04:22:11.680><c> but</c><04:22:12.840><c> so</c><04:22:13.000><c> I</c>

04:22:13.070 --> 04:22:13.080 align:start position:0%
specifically the last one uh but so I
 

04:22:13.080 --> 04:22:14.429 align:start position:0%
specifically the last one uh but so I
think<04:22:13.199><c> like</c><04:22:13.359><c> the</c><04:22:13.479><c> first</c><04:22:13.720><c> two</c><04:22:13.960><c> it's</c><04:22:14.279><c> it's</c>

04:22:14.429 --> 04:22:14.439 align:start position:0%
think like the first two it's it's
 

04:22:14.439 --> 04:22:15.950 align:start position:0%
think like the first two it's it's
actually<04:22:14.680><c> like</c><04:22:14.880><c> really</c><04:22:15.159><c> not</c><04:22:15.439><c> important</c><04:22:15.800><c> for</c>

04:22:15.950 --> 04:22:15.960 align:start position:0%
actually like really not important for
 

04:22:15.960 --> 04:22:18.109 align:start position:0%
actually like really not important for

04:22:18.109 --> 04:22:18.119 align:start position:0%
players to like you jump in and you buy
 

04:22:18.119 --> 04:22:19.590 align:start position:0%
players to like you jump in and you buy
and<04:22:18.199><c> you</c><04:22:18.279><c> see</c><04:22:18.479><c> the</c><04:22:18.600><c> prices</c><04:22:18.920><c> going</c><04:22:19.199><c> up</c><04:22:19.359><c> and</c><04:22:19.479><c> you</c>

04:22:19.590 --> 04:22:19.600 align:start position:0%
and you see the prices going up and you
 

04:22:19.600 --> 04:22:23.630 align:start position:0%
and you see the prices going up and you
like<04:22:19.760><c> they</c><04:22:19.920><c> kind</c><04:22:20.000><c> of</c><04:22:20.119><c> feel</c><04:22:20.560><c> the</c><04:22:20.800><c> curve</c><04:22:21.600><c> um</c><04:22:22.640><c> but</c>

04:22:23.630 --> 04:22:23.640 align:start position:0%
like they kind of feel the curve um but
 

04:22:23.640 --> 04:22:24.990 align:start position:0%
like they kind of feel the curve um but
I<04:22:23.720><c> think</c><04:22:23.960><c> like</c><04:22:24.119><c> if</c><04:22:24.199><c> you</c><04:22:24.319><c> want</c><04:22:24.680><c> if</c><04:22:24.760><c> you're</c><04:22:24.880><c> like</c>

04:22:24.990 --> 04:22:25.000 align:start position:0%
I think like if you want if you're like
 

04:22:25.000 --> 04:22:27.630 align:start position:0%
I think like if you want if you're like
a<04:22:25.119><c> words</c><04:22:25.520><c> three</c><04:22:26.000><c> power</c><04:22:26.439><c> player</c><04:22:26.920><c> which</c><04:22:27.399><c> there</c>

04:22:27.630 --> 04:22:27.640 align:start position:0%
a words three power player which there
 

04:22:27.640 --> 04:22:30.070 align:start position:0%
a words three power player which there
definitely<04:22:28.080><c> were</c><04:22:28.920><c> you</c><04:22:29.080><c> know</c><04:22:29.359><c> you</c><04:22:29.520><c> you</c><04:22:29.680><c> go</c><04:22:29.880><c> in</c>

04:22:30.070 --> 04:22:30.080 align:start position:0%
definitely were you know you you go in
 

04:22:30.080 --> 04:22:31.750 align:start position:0%
definitely were you know you you go in
and<04:22:30.239><c> you</c><04:22:30.680><c> understand</c><04:22:30.920><c> how</c><04:22:31.080><c> the</c><04:22:31.239><c> curve</c><04:22:31.560><c> and</c><04:22:31.680><c> the</c>

04:22:31.750 --> 04:22:31.760 align:start position:0%
and you understand how the curve and the
 

04:22:31.760 --> 04:22:33.870 align:start position:0%
and you understand how the curve and the
math<04:22:32.080><c> behind</c><04:22:32.319><c> the</c><04:22:32.479><c> curve</c><04:22:32.840><c> works</c><04:22:33.600><c> and</c><04:22:33.760><c> that</c>

04:22:33.870 --> 04:22:33.880 align:start position:0%
math behind the curve works and that
 

04:22:33.880 --> 04:22:36.030 align:start position:0%
math behind the curve works and that
one's<04:22:34.199><c> like</c><04:22:34.600><c> and</c><04:22:34.760><c> if</c><04:22:34.960><c> I</c><04:22:35.080><c> think</c><04:22:35.319><c> like</c><04:22:35.760><c> if</c><04:22:35.880><c> you</c>

04:22:36.030 --> 04:22:36.040 align:start position:0%
one's like and if I think like if you
 

04:22:36.040 --> 04:22:37.349 align:start position:0%
one's like and if I think like if you
have<04:22:36.159><c> a</c><04:22:36.359><c> strong</c><04:22:36.840><c> understanding</c><04:22:37.040><c> of</c><04:22:37.119><c> how</c><04:22:37.239><c> the</c>

04:22:37.349 --> 04:22:37.359 align:start position:0%
have a strong understanding of how the
 

04:22:37.359 --> 04:22:38.630 align:start position:0%
have a strong understanding of how the
curve<04:22:37.600><c> works</c><04:22:37.840><c> it</c><04:22:38.000><c> does</c><04:22:38.239><c> give</c><04:22:38.359><c> you</c><04:22:38.479><c> an</c>

04:22:38.630 --> 04:22:38.640 align:start position:0%
curve works it does give you an
 

04:22:38.640 --> 04:22:41.389 align:start position:0%
curve works it does give you an
advantage<04:22:38.960><c> in</c><04:22:39.080><c> the</c><04:22:39.279><c> game</c><04:22:39.560><c> in</c><04:22:39.680><c> the</c><04:22:39.880><c> last</c><04:22:40.399><c> case</c>

04:22:41.389 --> 04:22:41.399 align:start position:0%
advantage in the game in the last case
 

04:22:41.399 --> 04:22:42.790 align:start position:0%
advantage in the game in the last case
yeah<04:22:41.520><c> that's</c><04:22:41.720><c> another</c><04:22:41.960><c> thing</c><04:22:42.080><c> too</c><04:22:42.239><c> is</c><04:22:42.600><c> there's</c>

04:22:42.790 --> 04:22:42.800 align:start position:0%
yeah that's another thing too is there's
 

04:22:42.800 --> 04:22:44.229 align:start position:0%
yeah that's another thing too is there's
lots<04:22:42.960><c> of</c><04:22:43.119><c> complicated</c><04:22:43.680><c> constructions</c><04:22:44.159><c> that</c>

04:22:44.229 --> 04:22:44.239 align:start position:0%
lots of complicated constructions that
 

04:22:44.239 --> 04:22:46.070 align:start position:0%
lots of complicated constructions that
are<04:22:44.439><c> better</c><04:22:45.040><c> like</c><04:22:45.199><c> you</c><04:22:45.399><c> also</c><04:22:45.680><c> want</c><04:22:45.880><c> your</c>

04:22:46.070 --> 04:22:46.080 align:start position:0%
are better like you also want your
 

04:22:46.080 --> 04:22:47.710 align:start position:0%
are better like you also want your
construction<04:22:46.520><c> to</c><04:22:46.640><c> be</c><04:22:46.800><c> like</c><04:22:47.000><c> as</c><04:22:47.159><c> simple</c><04:22:47.479><c> as</c>

04:22:47.710 --> 04:22:47.720 align:start position:0%
construction to be like as simple as
 

04:22:47.720 --> 04:22:50.469 align:start position:0%
construction to be like as simple as
possible<04:22:48.000><c> for</c><04:22:48.199><c> this</c><04:22:48.399><c> reason</c><04:22:49.159><c> and</c><04:22:49.279><c> so</c><04:22:49.560><c> you</c><04:22:49.720><c> know</c>

04:22:50.469 --> 04:22:50.479 align:start position:0%
possible for this reason and so you know
 

04:22:50.479 --> 04:22:53.149 align:start position:0%
possible for this reason and so you know
trade-offs<04:22:51.479><c> yeah</c>

04:22:53.149 --> 04:22:53.159 align:start position:0%
trade-offs yeah
 

04:22:53.159 --> 04:22:55.630 align:start position:0%
trade-offs yeah
um<04:22:54.159><c> we</c><04:22:54.319><c> have</c><04:22:54.520><c> two</c><04:22:54.760><c> questions</c><04:22:55.119><c> that</c><04:22:55.279><c> have</c><04:22:55.399><c> to</c><04:22:55.479><c> do</c>

04:22:55.630 --> 04:22:55.640 align:start position:0%
um we have two questions that have to do
 

04:22:55.640 --> 04:22:57.670 align:start position:0%
um we have two questions that have to do
with<04:22:55.800><c> past</c><04:22:56.159><c> projects</c><04:22:56.800><c> yeah</c><04:22:56.920><c> so</c><04:22:57.080><c> one</c><04:22:57.279><c> is</c><04:22:57.560><c> what</c>

04:22:57.670 --> 04:22:57.680 align:start position:0%
with past projects yeah so one is what
 

04:22:57.680 --> 04:22:59.469 align:start position:0%
with past projects yeah so one is what
is<04:22:57.760><c> the</c><04:22:57.960><c> next</c><04:22:58.159><c> plan</c><04:22:58.399><c> for</c><04:22:58.560><c> Network</c><04:22:58.920><c> State</c><04:22:59.399><c> and</c>

04:22:59.469 --> 04:22:59.479 align:start position:0%
is the next plan for Network State and
 

04:22:59.479 --> 04:23:00.710 align:start position:0%
is the next plan for Network State and
then<04:22:59.640><c> the</c><04:22:59.720><c> other</c><04:22:59.880><c> one</c><04:23:00.040><c> is</c><04:23:00.199><c> what's</c><04:23:00.399><c> happening</c>

04:23:00.710 --> 04:23:00.720 align:start position:0%
then the other one is what's happening
 

04:23:00.720 --> 04:23:02.910 align:start position:0%
then the other one is what's happening
with<04:23:01.000><c> wor</c><04:23:01.520><c> words</c><04:23:01.840><c> three</c><04:23:02.119><c> in</c><04:23:02.199><c> terms</c><04:23:02.439><c> of</c><04:23:02.560><c> users</c>

04:23:02.910 --> 04:23:02.920 align:start position:0%
with wor words three in terms of users
 

04:23:02.920 --> 04:23:04.950 align:start position:0%
with wor words three in terms of users
currently<04:23:03.560><c> yeah</c><04:23:03.760><c> both</c><04:23:03.920><c> are</c><04:23:04.080><c> good</c><04:23:04.319><c> questions</c><04:23:04.880><c> I</c>

04:23:04.950 --> 04:23:04.960 align:start position:0%
currently yeah both are good questions I
 

04:23:04.960 --> 04:23:06.630 align:start position:0%
currently yeah both are good questions I
think<04:23:05.239><c> words</c><04:23:05.520><c> three</c><04:23:05.720><c> in</c><04:23:05.800><c> terms</c><04:23:06.000><c> of</c><04:23:06.159><c> users</c>

04:23:06.630 --> 04:23:06.640 align:start position:0%
think words three in terms of users
 

04:23:06.640 --> 04:23:08.389 align:start position:0%
think words three in terms of users
currently<04:23:07.080><c> is</c><04:23:07.399><c> I</c><04:23:07.479><c> think</c><04:23:07.600><c> they're</c><04:23:07.760><c> like</c><04:23:07.960><c> two</c>

04:23:08.389 --> 04:23:08.399 align:start position:0%
currently is I think they're like two
 

04:23:08.399 --> 04:23:11.590 align:start position:0%
currently is I think they're like two
like<04:23:08.520><c> it's</c><04:23:08.720><c> not</c><04:23:09.000><c> much</c><04:23:10.080><c> uh</c><04:23:11.080><c> and</c><04:23:11.199><c> like</c><04:23:11.319><c> words</c>

04:23:11.590 --> 04:23:11.600 align:start position:0%
like it's not much uh and like words
 

04:23:11.600 --> 04:23:13.630 align:start position:0%
like it's not much uh and like words
three<04:23:11.880><c> tends</c><04:23:12.199><c> tend</c><04:23:12.640><c> have</c><04:23:12.800><c> like</c><04:23:12.920><c> a</c><04:23:13.080><c> bunch</c><04:23:13.319><c> of</c>

04:23:13.630 --> 04:23:13.640 align:start position:0%
three tends tend have like a bunch of
 

04:23:13.640 --> 04:23:15.790 align:start position:0%
three tends tend have like a bunch of
activity<04:23:14.239><c> the</c><04:23:14.439><c> first</c><04:23:14.760><c> couple</c><04:23:15.000><c> of</c><04:23:15.199><c> weeks</c><04:23:15.680><c> and</c>

04:23:15.790 --> 04:23:15.800 align:start position:0%
activity the first couple of weeks and
 

04:23:15.800 --> 04:23:18.670 align:start position:0%
activity the first couple of weeks and
then<04:23:16.000><c> kind</c><04:23:16.119><c> of</c><04:23:16.279><c> petered</c><04:23:16.800><c> out</c><04:23:17.359><c> I</c><04:23:17.439><c> think</c><04:23:17.680><c> like</c><04:23:18.560><c> it</c>

04:23:18.670 --> 04:23:18.680 align:start position:0%
then kind of petered out I think like it
 

04:23:18.680 --> 04:23:21.510 align:start position:0%
then kind of petered out I think like it
will<04:23:19.080><c> come</c><04:23:19.479><c> back</c><04:23:20.119><c> like</c><04:23:20.720><c> there's</c><04:23:20.880><c> like</c><04:23:21.080><c> clear</c>

06:12:13.270 --> 06:12:13.280 align:start position:0%
things and you earn money and you expand
 

06:12:13.280 --> 06:12:15.670 align:start position:0%

your<06:12:13.440><c> City</c><06:12:13.760><c> to</c><06:12:14.000><c> like</c><06:12:14.120><c> a</c><06:12:14.280><c> bigger</c><06:12:14.600><c> fancier</c><06:12:15.080><c> City</c>

06:12:15.670 --> 06:12:15.680 align:start position:0%
your City to like a bigger fancier City
 

06:12:15.680 --> 06:12:17.510 align:start position:0%

so<06:12:15.878><c> that</c><06:12:16.000><c> is</c><06:12:16.120><c> simple</c><06:12:16.478><c> and</c><06:12:16.680><c> very</c><06:12:16.920><c> common</c><06:12:17.360><c> in</c>

06:12:17.510 --> 06:12:17.520 align:start position:0%
so that is simple and very common in
 

06:12:17.520 --> 06:12:20.030 align:start position:0%
so that is simple and very common in

06:16:24.920 --> 06:16:26.350 align:start position:0%
design um so I would like recommend even
though<06:16:25.160><c> maybe</c><06:16:25.400><c> your</c><06:16:25.600><c> game</c><06:16:25.798><c> doesn't</c><06:16:26.120><c> really</c>

06:16:26.350 --> 06:16:26.360 align:start position:0%
though maybe your game doesn't really
 

06:16:26.360 --> 06:16:28.430 align:start position:0%
though maybe your game doesn't really
have<06:16:26.478><c> a</c><06:16:26.638><c> price</c><06:16:27.000><c> Po</c><06:16:27.478><c> build-in</c><06:16:28.000><c> in</c><06:16:28.120><c> terms</c><06:16:28.320><c> of</c>

06:16:28.430 --> 06:16:28.440 align:start position:0%
have a price Po build-in in terms of

have a price Po build-in in terms of
mechanics<06:16:28.920><c> you</c><06:16:29.000><c> could</c><06:16:29.160><c> still</c><06:16:29.440><c> try</c><06:16:29.718><c> it</c><06:16:30.440><c> um</c><06:16:30.680><c> to</c>

06:16:31.150 --> 06:16:31.160 align:start position:0%
mechanics you could still try it um to
 

06:16:31.160 --> 06:16:32.788 align:start position:0%
mechanics you could still try it um to
test<06:16:31.440><c> out</c><06:16:31.840><c> maybe</c><06:16:32.040><c> like</c><06:16:32.160><c> a</c><06:16:32.240><c> new</c><06:16:32.360><c> feature</c><06:16:32.718><c> that</c>

06:16:32.788 --> 06:16:32.798 align:start position:0%
test out maybe like a new feature that
 

06:16:32.798 --> 06:16:33.670 align:start position:0%
test out maybe like a new feature that
you<06:16:32.878><c> want</c><06:16:33.000><c> to</c>

06:24:39.708 --> 06:24:39.718 align:start position:0%
um so I would say maybe but I would I
 

06:24:39.718 --> 06:24:41.468 align:start position:0%
um so I would say maybe but I would I
wouldn't<06:24:39.920><c> say</c><06:24:40.040><c> it's</c><06:24:40.160><c> like</c><06:24:40.280><c> a</c><06:24:40.400><c> core</c><06:24:40.878><c> game</c><06:24:41.080><c> Loop</c>

06:24:41.468 --> 06:24:41.478 align:start position:0%
wouldn't say it's like a core game Loop
 

06:24:41.478 --> 06:24:44.190 align:start position:0%
wouldn't say it's like a core game Loop
that<06:24:41.760><c> we</c><06:24:41.878><c> want</c><06:24:42.000><c> to</c><06:24:42.240><c> add</c><06:24:43.240><c> so</c><06:24:43.520><c> the</c><06:24:43.638><c> next</c><06:24:43.878><c> question</c>

06:24:44.190 --> 06:24:44.200 align:start position:0%
that we want to add so the next question
 

06:24:44.200 --> 06:24:46.030 align:start position:0%
that we want to add so the next question
I<06:24:44.280><c> think</c><06:24:44.400><c> is</c><06:24:44.600><c> really</c><06:24:44.798><c> funny</c><06:24:45.200><c> because</c><06:24:45.878><c> that's</c>

06:24:46.030 --> 06:24:46.040 align:start position:0%
I think is really funny because that's
 

06:24:46.040 --> 06:24:48.150 align:start position:0%
I think is really funny because that's

06:24:48.150 --> 06:24:48.160 align:start position:0%
what the entire talk was about but is
 

06:24:48.160 --> 06:24:51.190 align:start position:0%
what the entire talk was about but is
financialization<06:24:49.160><c> required</c><06:24:49.680><c> for</c><06:24:49.878><c> onchain</c>

games<06:24:52.200><c> um</c><06:24:53.160><c> I</c><06:24:53.280><c> would</c><06:24:53.638><c> say</c><06:24:54.520><c> it</c><06:24:54.760><c> really</c><06:24:55.160><c> depends</c>

06:24:55.548 --> 06:24:55.558 align:start position:0%
games um I would say it really depends
 

06:24:55.558 --> 06:24:58.788 align:start position:0%
games um I would say it really depends
on<06:24:55.840><c> what</c><06:24:56.080><c> you</c><06:24:56.280><c> are</c><06:24:56.600><c> trying</c><06:24:56.958><c> to</c><06:24:57.478><c> achieve</c><06:24:58.478><c> um</c><06:24:58.718><c> I</c>

06:24:58.788 --> 06:24:58.798 align:start position:0%
on what you are trying to achieve um I
 

06:24:58.798 --> 06:25:01.548 align:start position:0%
on what you are trying to achieve um I
think<06:24:58.920><c> onch</c><06:24:59.558><c> game</c><06:24:59.878><c> enables</c><06:25:00.798><c> different</c><06:25:01.160><c> things</c>

06:25:01.548 --> 06:25:01.558 align:start position:0%
think onch game enables different things
 

06:25:01.558 --> 06:25:05.190 align:start position:0%
think onch game enables different things
it's<06:25:01.718><c> like</c><06:25:01.920><c> open</c><06:25:02.240><c> source</c><06:25:02.718><c> it's</c><06:25:03.160><c> composable</c><06:25:04.638><c> um</c>

06:25:05.190 --> 06:25:05.200 align:start position:0%
it's like open source it's composable um
 

06:25:05.200 --> 06:25:09.590 align:start position:0%
it's like open source it's composable um
it's<06:25:05.440><c> bable</c><06:25:06.080><c> right</c><06:25:06.320><c> so</c><06:25:07.240><c> um</c><06:25:07.920><c> if</c>

06:25:09.590 --> 06:25:09.600 align:start position:0%
it's bable right so um if
 

06:25:09.600 --> 06:25:12.750 align:start position:0%
it's bable right so um if
deliver<06:25:10.600><c> financial</c><06:25:11.160><c> gain</c><06:25:11.600><c> as</c><06:25:12.200><c> the</c><06:25:12.360><c> source</c><06:25:12.600><c> of</c>

06:25:14.590 --> 06:25:14.600 align:start position:0%
fund is the purpose of the game yes you
 

06:25:14.600 --> 06:25:17.670 align:start position:0%
fund is the purpose of the game yes you
should<06:25:14.798><c> add</c><06:25:15.040><c> it</c><06:25:15.718><c> but</c><06:25:16.600><c> if</c><06:25:16.798><c> not</c><06:25:17.280><c> maybe</c><06:25:17.558><c> you</c>

06:25:17.670 --> 06:25:17.680 align:start position:0%
should add it but if not maybe you
 

06:25:17.680 --> 06:25:19.030 align:start position:0%
should add it but if not maybe you
shouldn't<06:25:18.400><c> right</c><06:25:18.558><c> I</c><06:25:18.638><c> think</c><06:25:18.760><c> it</c><06:25:18.840><c> really</c>

06:25:19.030 --> 06:25:19.040 align:start position:0%
shouldn't right I think it really
 

06:25:19.040 --> 06:25:20.548 align:start position:0%
shouldn't right I think it really
depends<06:25:19.320><c> on</c><06:25:19.478><c> like</c><06:25:19.680><c> what</c><06:25:19.958><c> experience</c><06:25:20.400><c> you're</c>

06:25:20.548 --> 06:25:20.558 align:start position:0%

you get to see the raw input it doesn't
you<06:30:10.240><c> don't</c><06:30:10.520><c> it</c><06:30:10.600><c> doesn't</c><06:30:10.878><c> make</c><06:30:11.080><c> sense</c><06:30:11.760><c> what</c><06:30:11.958><c> you</c>

06:30:12.070 --> 06:30:12.080 align:start position:0%
you don't it doesn't make sense what you
 

06:30:12.080 --> 06:30:13.788 align:start position:0%
you don't it doesn't make sense what you

06:30:13.788 --> 06:30:13.798 align:start position:0%
have to do is you have to decode the
 

06:30:13.798 --> 06:30:16.430 align:start position:0%
have to do is you have to decode the
data<06:30:14.280><c> to</c><06:30:14.440><c> make</c><06:30:14.600><c> it</c><06:30:14.798><c> actually</c><06:30:15.160><c> useful</c><06:30:16.080><c> once</c><06:30:16.280><c> you</c>

06:30:16.430 --> 06:30:16.440 align:start position:0%

contra contct things like that and we
 

06:49:03.600 --> 06:49:05.510 align:start position:0%

uh yeah in my view U we have people here
 

06:49:25.878 --> 06:49:27.310 align:start position:0%
uh yeah in my view U we have people here
there<06:49:26.000><c> is</c><06:49:26.120><c> a</c><06:49:26.200><c> lot</c><06:49:26.360><c> of</c><06:49:26.478><c> energy</c><06:49:26.958><c> there's</c><06:49:27.080><c> a</c><06:49:27.200><c> lot</c>

06:49:27.310 --> 06:49:27.320 align:start position:0%
there is a lot of energy there's a lot
 

06:49:27.320 --> 06:49:29.590 align:start position:0%
there is a lot of energy there's a lot
of<06:49:27.520><c> activity</c><06:49:28.440><c> we're</c><06:49:28.680><c> producing</c><06:49:29.120><c> a</c><06:49:29.240><c> lot</c><06:49:29.360><c> of</c>

06:49:29.590 --> 06:49:29.600 align:start position:0%

06:49:29.600 --> 06:49:31.590 align:start position:0%
of activity we're producing a lot of
data<06:49:30.120><c> and</c><06:49:30.240><c> then</c><06:49:30.398><c> we</c><06:49:30.520><c> could</c><06:49:30.718><c> do</c><06:49:30.958><c> things</c><06:49:31.280><c> like</c><06:49:31.398><c> so</c>

06:49:31.590 --> 06:49:31.600 align:start position:0%
data and then we could do things like so
 

06:49:31.600 --> 06:49:33.868 align:start position:0%
data and then we could do things like so
maybe<06:49:32.398><c> maybe</c><06:49:32.878><c> this</c><06:49:33.000><c> could</c><06:49:33.120><c> be</c><06:49:33.280><c> the</c><06:49:33.478><c> perfect</c>

06:49:33.868 --> 06:49:33.878 align:start position:0%
maybe maybe this could be the perfect
 

06:49:33.878 --> 06:49:36.708 align:start position:0%
maybe maybe this could be the perfect

I and I ran it earlier today so it it
does<06:50:25.920><c> stuff</c><06:50:26.200><c> so</c><06:50:26.440><c> you</c><06:50:26.520><c> just</c><06:50:26.760><c> have</c><06:50:26.920><c> to</c><06:50:27.040><c> get</c><06:50:27.160><c> a</c>

06:50:29.788 --> 06:50:29.798 align:start position:0%
remote desktop like open up a browser
 

06:50:29.798 --> 06:50:32.190 align:start position:0%
remote desktop like open up a browser
and<06:50:29.920><c> it</c><06:50:30.040><c> could</c><06:50:30.200><c> run</c><06:50:30.398><c> on</c><06:50:30.520><c> a</c><06:50:30.680><c> cloud</c><06:50:31.040><c> really</c><06:50:32.040><c> okay</c>

06:50:32.190 --> 06:50:32.200 align:start position:0%
and it could run on a cloud really okay
 

06:50:32.200 --> 06:50:34.150 align:start position:0%
and it could run on a cloud really okay
so<06:50:32.320><c> the</c><06:50:32.440><c> next</c><06:50:32.798><c> question</c><06:50:33.000><c> is</c><06:50:33.120><c> one</c><06:50:33.360><c> I'm</c><06:50:33.520><c> also</c>

06:50:47.788 --> 06:50:47.798 align:start position:0%
them into the world yeah yes uh there
 

06:50:47.798 --> 06:50:49.788 align:start position:0%
them into the world yeah yes uh there
are<06:50:48.360><c> there</c><06:50:48.478><c> are</c><06:50:48.680><c> a</c><06:50:48.760><c> few</c><06:50:48.958><c> ways</c><06:50:49.200><c> we</c><06:50:49.360><c> think</c><06:50:49.600><c> about</c>

06:50:49.788 --> 06:50:49.798 align:start position:0%
are there are a few ways we think about
 

06:50:49.798 --> 06:50:52.868 align:start position:0%
are there are a few ways we think about
it<06:50:50.280><c> first</c><06:50:50.520><c> is</c><06:50:50.718><c> like</c><06:50:50.878><c> an</c><06:50:51.080><c> agent</c><06:50:51.958><c> who</c><06:50:52.120><c> owns</c><06:50:52.520><c> an</c>

06:50:52.868 --> 06:50:52.878 align:start position:0%
it first is like an agent who owns an
 

06:50:52.878 --> 06:50:55.628 align:start position:0%
it first is like an agent who owns an
agent<06:50:53.240><c> like</c><06:50:53.360><c> so</c><06:50:53.840><c> in</c><06:50:54.000><c> terms</c><06:50:54.240><c> of</c><06:50:54.360><c> an</c><06:50:54.558><c> agent</c><06:50:55.398><c> who</c>

06:50:55.628 --> 06:50:55.638 align:start position:0%
agent like so in terms of an agent who
 

06:50:55.638 --> 06:50:57.910 align:start position:0%
agent like so in terms of an agent who
controls<06:50:56.160><c> it</c><06:50:56.360><c> so</c><06:50:56.760><c> I</c><06:50:56.878><c> spoke</c><06:50:57.160><c> about</c><06:50:57.478><c> different</c>

06:50:57.910 --> 06:50:57.920 align:start position:0%
controls it so I spoke about different
 

06:50:57.920 --> 06:51:00.030 align:start position:0%
controls it so I spoke about different
owners<06:50:58.398><c> so</c><06:50:58.600><c> there</c><06:50:58.718><c> are</c><06:50:59.360><c> there</c><06:50:59.440><c> are</c><06:50:59.600><c> people</c><06:50:59.840><c> who</c>

06:51:00.030 --> 06:51:00.040 align:start position:0%
owners so there are there are people who
 

06:51:00.040 --> 06:51:02.948 align:start position:0%
owners so there are there are people who
provide<06:51:00.360><c> the</c><06:51:00.520><c> hardware</c><06:51:01.240><c> there</c><06:51:02.080><c> people</c><06:51:02.280><c> who</c>

06:51:02.948 --> 06:51:02.958 align:start position:0%
provide the hardware there people who
 

06:51:02.958 --> 06:51:05.430 align:start position:0%
provide the hardware there people who
who<06:51:03.160><c> bring</c><06:51:03.878><c> who</c><06:51:04.120><c> develop</c><06:51:04.520><c> it</c><06:51:04.718><c> there's</c><06:51:05.040><c> IP</c>

06:51:05.430 --> 06:51:05.440 align:start position:0%
who bring who develop it there's IP
 

06:51:05.440 --> 06:51:08.350 align:start position:0%
who bring who develop it there's IP
there's<06:51:05.680><c> quite</c><06:51:05.798><c> a</c><06:51:05.920><c> few</c><06:51:06.160><c> things</c><06:51:06.398><c> so</c><06:51:07.200><c> uh</c><06:51:07.600><c> in</c><06:51:07.798><c> in</c>

06:51:14.590 --> 06:51:14.600 align:start position:0%
people who control and own the agent and
 

06:51:14.600 --> 06:51:17.110 align:start position:0%
people who control and own the agent and
then<06:51:14.878><c> then</c><06:51:15.080><c> like</c><06:51:15.878><c> how</c><06:51:16.000><c> do</c><06:51:16.120><c> you</c><06:51:16.240><c> bring</c><06:51:16.478><c> them</c><06:51:16.718><c> in</c>

06:51:20.430 --> 06:51:20.440 align:start position:0%
the apis and things like that that's how
 

06:51:20.440 --> 06:51:23.310 align:start position:0%
the apis and things like that that's how
we<06:51:20.600><c> interact</c><06:51:21.000><c> with</c><06:51:21.160><c> the</c><06:51:21.360><c> world</c><06:51:22.360><c> and</c><06:51:22.840><c> uh</c><06:51:23.160><c> yeah</c>

06:51:23.310 --> 06:51:23.320 align:start position:0%
we interact with the world and uh yeah
 

06:51:23.320 --> 06:51:25.830 align:start position:0%
we interact with the world and uh yeah
we<06:51:23.478><c> could</c><06:51:24.080><c> yeah</c><06:51:24.360><c> that's</c><06:51:25.120><c> okay</c><06:51:25.360><c> and</c><06:51:25.520><c> I</c><06:51:25.638><c> think</c>

06:51:25.830 --> 06:51:25.840 align:start position:0%
we could yeah that's okay and I think
 

06:51:25.840 --> 06:51:28.030 align:start position:0%
we could yeah that's okay and I think
this<06:51:25.920><c> is</c><06:51:26.160><c> probably</c><06:51:26.398><c> the</c><06:51:26.600><c> last</c><06:51:26.920><c> question</c><06:51:27.920><c> what</c>

this is probably the last question what
 

06:51:28.040 --> 06:51:29.990 align:start position:0%
this is probably the last question what

06:51:34.680 --> 06:51:37.190 align:start position:0%
years of yman yeah so Yan's been uh it
takes<06:51:35.000><c> time</c><06:51:35.240><c> to</c><06:51:35.878><c> build</c><06:51:36.160><c> a</c><06:51:36.360><c> platform</c><06:51:36.840><c> like</c><06:51:37.040><c> this</c>

06:51:37.190 --> 06:51:37.200 align:start position:0%
